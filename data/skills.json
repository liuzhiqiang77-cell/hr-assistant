This provides motivation for presenters to perform at their best.\n\n## Roles and Responsibilities\n\n### Organizing Manager (Supervisor)\n- Decide what issues to discuss, emphasize, and the level of detail\n- Handle housekeeping (room, visuals, invitations)\n- Act as timekeeper: Schedule presentations and keep them moving using inconspicuous gestures to prevent running out of time\n\n### Reviewing Manager (Senior Supervisor)\n- Ask questions, make comments, and impart the appropriate spirit\n- Act as a catalyst to provoke audience participation and encourage free expression by example\n- **NEVER preview the material** to ensure spontaneous reaction\n- Take the role seriously as a model for junior managers\n\n### Presenters\n- Use visual aids (overhead transparencies) to engage eyes and ears simultaneously\n- **Rule of Thumb**: Allow four minutes of presentation and discussion time per visual aid (tables, numbers, graphics)\n- Highlight emphasis using a color pen or pointer\n- Monitor the audience \"like a hawk\" using facial expressions and body language to adjust speed or clarify points\n\n### Audience\n- Participate actively by asking questions and making comments\n- Avoid disengagement behaviors (avoiding eyes, yawning, reading newspaper) as this undermines presenter confidence\n- Correct factual errors publicly (it is your responsibility)\n- Regard attendance as work, not a \"siesta\"\n\n## Time Management Formula\nCalculate presentation time...",

Identify the performance issue: The person is not doing their job.\n2. Ask the critical question: \"If the person's life depended on doing the work, could they do it?\"\n3. Evaluate the answer:\n   - **YES**: The person is capable but NOT motivated. They \"won't do it\" (motivation issue).\n   - **NO**: The person is NOT capable. They \"can't do it\" (capability issue).\n4. Select the managerial intervention:\n   - For \"Can't do it\" (Capability): Use Training.\n   - For \"Won't do it\" (Motivation): Use Motivation strategies.\n\n**Key Insight**: These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job. All other interventions are ineffective unless individuals try to offer their best.\n\n## Task-Relevant Maturity Management Style\n\nUse this when deciding between hands-on or hands-off management for a specific task.\n\n### Assessment and Action\n\n1. Assess the employee's maturity level specifically for the task at hand (Task-Relevant Maturity).\n2. Determine the appropriate management style:\n   - **IF employee is immature in the task**:\n     - Apply **hands-on training**.\n     - **Critical constraint**: Do NOT allow the employee to \"make their own mistakes\" to learn.\n     - **Reasoning**: The subordinate's tuition is paid by their customers, which is absolutely wrong.\n   - **IF employee is more mature in the task**:\n     - Apply a **delegate approach** (hands-off management).\n\n### Decision Quality Indicator\n\nThis decision-making process distinguishes the top 5% of managers who think deeply about their craft from the 95% who do not.\n\n## Integration of Approaches\n\n- Use the \"Can't vs. Won't\" diagnostic to identify the root cause.\n- Use Task-Relevant Maturity to determine the appropriate management style for the specific task....",

Calculate Leverage Potential\nRecognize that a small time investment (e.g., 1.5 hours) can enhance the quality of a subordinate's work for a significant duration (e.g., two weeks or 80+ hours).\n\n### 2. Establish Common Base\nUse the meeting to develop a \"common base of information\" and \"similar ways of doing and handling things\" between supervisor and subordinate. This shared base is essential for efficient delegation.\n\n### 3. Facilitate Reverse Teaching\nAllow the subordinate to teach the supervisor specific details and data that the supervisor may only be vaguely familiar with.

Ponder the data and consider their relationship to other industry indicators to distinguish between:\n- Temporary anomalies (e.g., seasonal slowness)\n- Actual business trends (e.g., business stopped growing)\n\n### 5.

Conduct Follow-up Interviews\nIf possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references:\n- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from reference checks\n- Clarify any discrepancies or concerns raised\n- Assess consistency between candidate claims and reference information\n\n### 5.

Apply the Attention Principle\n- Recognize indicators direct attention (like steering a bicycle)\n- \"You will probably steer it where you are looking\"\n- Design metrics to focus attention on desired outcomes\n\n### 2. Guard Against Overreaction\n- Be aware that single metrics can lead to extreme behaviors\n- Example: Driving inventory too low creates shortages\n- Balance competing objectives\n\n### 3. Implement Paired Indicators\n- Always pair indicators to measure both effect and counter-effect\n- Maintain optimum middle ground\n\n**Example Pairs**\n- Inventory Levels ↔ Incidence of Shortages\n- Completion Date ↔ Capability\n- (Prevents rushing OR perfectionism)\n\n### 4. Follow Administrative Indicator Criteria\n\n**Rule 1**: Any measurement is better than none\n\n**Rule 2**: Measure Output, Not Activity\n- Output = Results\n- Activity = Effort\n- Example: Measure orders obtained, not calls made\n\n**Rule 3**: Measure Physical/Countable Things\n- Examples: Vouchers processed, square feet cleaned, sales orders entered, transactions processed, people hired, items managed\n\n### 5. Apply Administrative Pairing Strategy\n\nPair Quantity/Output indicators with Quality indicators:\n\n| Domain | Quantity Indicator | Quality Indicator |\n|--------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Accounts Payable | # Vouchers processed | # Errors found |\n| Custodial | # Square feet cleaned | Quality rating by senior manager |\n| Production | Units produced | Defect rate |\n| Sales | Orders obtained | Customer satisfaction |",

    "body": "# Interviewing Strategy and Reference Protocol\n\n## When to Use\n- When planning an overall interviewing strategy for a role\n- When checking references after completing initial interviews\n- When conducting follow-up interviews with candidates\n- When analyzing the limitations and risks of the hiring process\n\n## Strategic Framework\n\n### 1. Define the Ultimate Purpose\nThe core objective of interviewing is to:\n- Judge the candidate's potential contribution in a new environment\n- Project past performance into your organization's context\n- Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit\n\n### 2. Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks\nFollow these principles throughout the interview process:\n- Do not use tricks or gimmicks to test character (e.g., three-legged chair)\n- Be completely straightforward with the candidate\n- Show yourself and the environment as they really are\n- **Rationale**: A candidate is a potential employee. Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired.\n\n## Reference Checking Protocol\n\n### Goal\nObtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly, but from an external source.\n\n### Build Rapport\n- **If you know the reference personally**: You have a better chance of getting real information\n- **If the reference is a stranger**: Keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond\n- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness\n\n### Timing Principle\nThe last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond.\n\n## Follow-up Interviews\n- If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references\n- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks\n- Clarify any discrepancies or concerns that emerged\n\n## Acknowledge Limitations\nRecognize the inherent constraints of the hiring process:\n- Careful interviewing does not guarantee success\n- The process merely increases the odds of hiring well\n- Acc...",

Success Definition: Output vs Attitude**\n- **Correct measure:** Better motivation equals better performance at a given skill level\n- **Incorrect measure:** Changes in attitude or feelings\n- A subordinate saying \"I feel motivated\" means nothing\n- Attitude is merely an indicator (window into the black box), not the desired result\n- The desired result is better performance\n\n## Contextual Approaches\n\n### Manual Labor Context\n- Output is readily measurable\n- Fear of punishment (e.g., loss of life/food) historically worked well\n- Clear production metrics available\n\n### Knowledge Worker Context\n- Output is difficult to measure immediately\n- Expectations are hard to state precisely\n- Fear will NOT work effectively (e.g., \"fear won't work as well with computer architects as with galley slaves\")\n- Requires humanistic approaches\n\n## When to Apply This Skill\n\nUse this framework when:\n- A manager needs to improve team output and suspects motivation is the root cause\n- Confusing attitude changes with performance improvements\n- Deciding between different management approaches for different types of workers\n- Clarifying the scope of managerial influence over motivation\n\n## Key Constraint\n\nNever attempt to directly change someone's attitude or feelings.

    "body": "# Delegation and Task Supervision\n\nEffective delegation requires shared values, accurate assessment of capability, and appropriate monitoring. This skill provides a complete workflow for delegating work and ensuring successful outcomes.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- Delegating tasks to free up managerial time\n- Assessing a subordinate's readiness for specific responsibilities\n- Monitoring work that has been delegated\n- Establishing new reporting relationships\n- Onboarding new subordinates\n\n## Core Workflow\n\n### 1. Establish Shared Operational Values\n\nBefore delegating, ensure you and your subordinate share a common understanding of:\n\n- **Operational values**: The correct way to do things\n- **Priorities**: What matters most in the organization\n- **Preferences**: How work gets done together\n\n**Critical Principle**: The supervisor is accountable for subordinate output. You cannot effectively delegate without shared values.\n\n**Anti-Pattern**: Do not allow subordinates to \"pay tuition\" by making mistakes that impact customers. Teach correct operational values early.\n\n### 2. Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)\n\nTRM is specific to the task, not general competence. Evaluate:\n\n- Achievement orientation (drive to succeed)\n- Readiness to take responsibility\n- Relevant education, training, and experience\n\n**Key Insight**: A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another. TRM can change day-to-day or hour-to-hour based on pace, environment, or task changes.\n\n### 3. Select and Delegate Tasks\n\n**Prerequisites for Delegation**:\n- Common information base exists between you and the subordinate\n- Shared operational ideas and values\n\n**Task Selection Rules**:\n- Delegate activities familiar to you (easier to monitor)\n- Avoid insincere delegation (emotionally holding on while pretending to delegate)\n- Never wash your hands of the task—you remain responsible\n\n**Core Principle**: \"Delegation without follow-through is abdication.\"\n\n### 4.

It combines:\n- Achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility\n- Education, training, and experience relevant to the specific task\n\nA person can have high TRM in one job but low in another. TRM can change day by day or hour by hour based on environment, pace, or job changes.\n\n### Operational Values\nBefore effective delegation can occur, you must establish a common information base with your subordinate:\n- Shared understanding of how the organization works together\n- Common priorities and preferences\n- The supervisor is accountable for teaching these values\n- Never let subordinates \"pay tuition\" through customer-impacting mistakes\n\n## Delegation Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Establish Common Information Base\nEnsure you and your subordinate share operational values, priorities, and preferences. Without this, delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage.\n\n### Step 2: Assess TRM\nEvaluate the subordinate's maturity for the specific task:\n- **Low TRM**: New to task, environment, or pace has accelerated\n- **Medium/Growing TRM**: Gaining experience and responsibility\n- **High TRM**: Experienced veteran with this specific task\n\n### Step 3: Select Tasks to Delegate\n- Delegate activities familiar to you rather than unfamiliar ones\n- Easier to monitor tasks you know best\n- Avoid insincere delegation (emotionally holding onto tasks while pretending to delegate)\n\n### Step 4: Delegate with Clear Responsibility\nRemember: \"Delegation without follow-through is abdication.\" You never wash your hands of the task.\n\n## Monitoring Workflow\n\n### ...",

Ignore | Passive ignoring | Pretends problem doesn't exist |\n| 2. Deny | Active denial | Admits nothing is wrong |\n| 3. Blame Others | Deflection | Admits problem exists but blames others |\n| 4. Assume Responsibility | Acceptance | Admits \"It is my problem\" |\n| 5. Find Solution | Problem-solving | Works on remedy |\n\n### Step 2: Facilitate Progression\n- **Ignore → Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality\n- **Deny → Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance\n- **Blame Others → Assume Responsibility**: Guide to take the \"biggest step\" (emotional step)\n- **Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**: Shared task, intellectual step (easier)\n\n**Critical Insight**: \"Assuming Responsibility\" is an emotional step (hard), while \"Finding Solution\" is an intellectual step (easier).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Outcomes\n- **Outcome 1**: Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure\n- **Outcome 2**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure\n- **Outcome 3**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit\n\n### Step 4: Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')\n1. Assume formal supervisor role with position power\n2. State clearly: \"This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do.\"\n3. Acknowledge disagreement: \"I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right.\"\n4.

The meeting also upgrades the supervisor's understanding of the subordinate's domain.\n\n### 2. Establish Common Base\nUse the meeting to develop:\n- A \"common base of information\" between supervisor and subordinate\n- \"Similar ways of doing and handling things\"\n- The foundation necessary for efficient and effective delegation\n\n### 3. Facilitate Reverse Teaching\nAllow the subordinate to teach you specific details and data that you may only be vaguely familiar with. This information is \"absolutely essential\" for making good decisions.\n\n### 4. Joint Data Analysis\nReview specific indicators (e.g., trend indicators of incoming orders) together. Ponder the data and consider their relationship to:\n- Other industry indicators\n- Temporary anomalies (e.g., seasonal slowness)\n- Actual business trends (e.g., business stopped growing)\n\n### 5. Formulate Congruent Conclusions\nDevelop a \"congruent attitude, approach, and conclusion\" based on shared analysis. Example: Deciding to take a \"conservative approach to near-term investment\" rather than assuming growth.\n\n### 6. Execute Cascading Actions\n- **Subordinate**: Implements decisions in their specific area of responsibility\n- **Supervisor**: Shares conclusions with other business groups or managers, multiplying the leverage across the organization\n\n## Constraints\n- Requires willingness to share information openly\n- Requires time investment from supervisor\n- Requires regular scheduled meeting time (e.g., every two weeks)",

Define the Ultimate Purpose\n\nThe goal of interviewing is to:\n- Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance\n- Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit\n\n### 2. Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks\n\n**Do Not Use Tricks:**\n- Avoid gimmicks like the \"three-legged chair\" to test character\n- These create wrong first impressions that take a long time to change if hired\n\n**Be Straightforward:**\n- Show yourself and the environment as they really are\n- Remember: a candidate is a potential employee, not a test subject\n\n### 3. Execute Reference Checking\n\n**Goal:** Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.\n\n**Rapport Building:**\n- If you know the reference personally, you have a better chance of getting \"real\" information\n- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond\n- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness\n\n**Timing:**\n- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond\n\n### 4. Conduct Follow-up Interviews\n\nIf possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references:\n- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from reference checks\n- Clarify any discrepancies or concerns\n\n### 5. Acknowledge Limitations\n\nRecognize that:\n- Careful interviewing does not guarantee success\n- It merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well\n- There is always a risk of failure in hiring decisions\n\n## Output\n\nThe proce...",

Origin of Motivation\n- Motivation must come from within the individual\n- A manager cannot \"do something to another person\" to motivate them directly\n- The manager's role is to create an environment in which motivated people can flourish\n\n### 2. Success Definition: Output vs. Attitude\n- **Better motivation equals better performance**, NOT a change of attitude or feeling\n- A subordinate saying \"I feel motivated\" means nothing\n- Attitude is merely an indicator (a \"window into the black box\"), not the desired result\n- The desired result is better performance at a given skill level\n\n### 3. Contextual Approach: Fear vs. Humanistic\n\n**Manual Labor:**\n- Output is readily measurable\n- Fear of punishment (e.g., loss of life/food) historically worked well\n- Expectations are clear and quantifiable\n\n**Knowledge Workers:**\n- Output is difficult to measure immediately\n- Expectations are hard to state precisely\n- Fear won't work as well (\"fear won't work as well with computer architects as with galley slaves\")\n- New humanistic approaches are required\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Diagnose the Problem**\n   - Determine if the issue is motivation or capability\n   - Identify the type of workers involved (manual vs knowledge)\n\n2. **Design the Environment**\n   - For manual labor: Clear metrics, measurable output, defined consequences\n   - For knowledge workers: Humanistic approach, focus on enabling conditions, intrinsic motivators\n\n3. **Focus on Performance**\n   - Set clear performance expectations\n   - Measure output, not attitude\n   - Use attitude only as a diagnostic indicator\n\n4. **Avoid Common Pitfalls**\n   - Don't try to force motivation directly\n  ...",

Everything else is useless unless individuals try to offer their best.\n\n## Part 2: Task-Relevant Maturity Management\n\nUse this when deciding between hands-on or hands-off management for a specific task.\n\n### Assessment Process\n\n1. **Assess the employee's maturity level** specifically for the task at hand (Task-Relevant Maturity).\n\n2. **Determine the appropriate management style**:\n\n   - **IF employee is IMMATURE in the task**:\n     - **Action**: Apply **hands-on training**\n     - **Critical Constraint**: Do NOT allow the employee to \"make their own mistakes\" to learn\n     - **Reasoning**: The subordinate's \"tuition\" would be paid by customers, which is absolutely wrong\n   \n   - **IF employee is MORE MATURE in the task**:\n     - **Action**: Apply a **delegate approach** (hands-off management)\n\n### Management Insight\n\nThis decision-making process distinguishes the top 5% of managers who think deeply about their craft from the 95% who do not.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n- Addressing poor ...",

Sit with a blank piece of paper\n2. Write \"everything down\" regarding the subordinate's performance\n3. Do not edit in your head; include things major, minor, and trivial in no particular order\n4. Understand that writing items down does not commit you to doing anything\n\n### Documentation Removal\nOnce you run out of items, put all supporting documentation away.\n\n### Relationship Analysis\nLook for relationships between items on the worksheet. Identify if items are different manifestations of the same phenomenon or indications of why strengths/weaknesses exist.\n\n### Message Formulation\nConvert identified relationships into \"messages\" for the subordinate.\n\n### Evidence Gathering\nFrom the worksheet, draw conclusions and specific examples to support them.\n\n...",

    "body": "# Performance Diagnostics Assessment\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n- A subordinate, team member, or employee is not performing their job\n- Evaluating a manager's performance rating\n- Reviewing performance where tangible output does not align with activities performed\n- Determining whether performance issues stem from capability or motivation\n\n## Core Diagnostic Workflows\n\n### 1. Capability vs. Motivation Diagnosis (The \"Life or Death\" Test)\n\n**Purpose:** Determine if a performance issue is due to lack of capability (can't do it) or lack of motivation (won't do it).\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. Identify the specific performance issue: the person is not doing their job\n2. Apply the diagnostic question: \"If this person's life depended on doing the work, could they do it?\"\n3. Evaluate the answer:\n   - **YES**: The person is capable but unmotivated → Use motivational strategies\n   - **NO**: The person is incapable → Use training\n4. Apply the appropriate intervention:\n   - Capability issue: Training\n   - Motivation issue: Motivation strategies\n\n**Critical Principle:** These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job. Addressing other causes is ineffective unless the individual attempts to offer their best.\n\n### 2. Manager Performance: The Potential Trap Rule\n\n**Purpose:** Prevent inflating manager ratings based on \"potential\" rather than actual organizational performance.\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. Evaluate actual performance and real output\n2. Ignore \"potential\" defined as form (knowledge, appearance, \"looking like a manager\")\n3. Apply the organization cap:\n   - **RULE**: Manager's performance rating cannot exceed the organization's rating\n4. Enforce consequences:\n   - If the business unit lost money, missed forecasts, slipped schedules, or showed poor internal measures, the manager cannot receive a high rating\n   - Reject excuses that the organization failed but the manager is \"outstanding\"\n5. Prevent negative signaling:\n   - Avoid reinforcing that \"acting\" like a manager is su...",

Only unsatisfied needs motivate.\n\n### The Satiation Rule\nA need once satisfied stops being a source of motivation. To maintain high motivation, keep some needs unsatisfied at all times.\n\n### Dominance Principle\n- People have multiple concurrent needs, but one need is always dominant\n- The dominant need determines behavior and performance level\n- When a lower need is satisfied, a higher need typically takes over\n\n### Regressive Movement (Edge Case)\nDrastic environmental changes (e.g., crisis, disaster) can cause instant regression from high-level needs to basic survival needs.\n\n## Diagnostic Method: Money Motivation Test\n\nUse this test when observing an employee's reaction to a salary increase or compensation change:\n\n### Step 1: Observe the Reaction Focus\n- **Scenario A:** Employee focuses on the **absolute sum** of money received\n- **Scenario B:** Employee focuses on **relative comparison** against others (ranking, fairness)\n\n### Step 2: Determine Motivation Mode\n\n| Reaction Focus | Motivation Mode | How Money is Viewed | Implications |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Absolute Sum | Physiological or Safety | Utilitarian resource to buy necessities | Motivation ceases when monetary target is met |\n| Relative Comparison | Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization | Measure of achievement / Scorecard | Motivation is boundless; 'second ten million' matters as much as first |\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Insight\n- **Lower levels:** Money satisfies a deficit need (filling a gap)\n- **Upper levels:** Money satisfies a growth need (signifying achievement)\n\n## Need Level C...",

Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks\n\n**Principles:**\n- Do not use \"tricks\" (e.g., three-legged chair) to test character\n- Be completely straightforward\n- Show yourself and the environment as they really are\n\n**Rationale:**\n- A candidate is a potential employee\n- Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired\n\n### 3. Execute Reference Checking\n\n**Goal:**\nObtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.\n\n**Rapport Building:**\n- If you know the reference personally, you have a better chance of getting \"real\" information\n- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond\n- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness\n\n**Timing Strategy:**\n- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond\n\n### 4. Conduct Follow-up Interviews\n\n- If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references\n- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks\n\n### 5.

You never wash your hands of the task; you remain responsible for its accomplishment.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n- You need to free up time by assigning work to subordinates\n- A subordinate is taking on a new task or responsibility\n- You need to assess how closely to supervise a task\n- You want to establish or strengthen a shared information base with your team\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)\n\nTRM is the combination of a subordinate's:\n- Achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility\n- Relevant education, training, and experience\n\n**Critical distinction:** TRM is task-specific, not general. A person can have high TRM in one area and low TRM in another. TRM can change day-by-day based on job pace, environment changes, or new responsibilities.\n\n### Operational Values\n\nEffective delegation requires a shared understanding of:\n- The correct way to do things\n- Organizational priorities and preferences\n- How the organization works together\n\nWithout shared operational values, you cannot delegate effectively—you remain accountable for all output.\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n### Step 1: Establish Shared Operational Values\n\nBefore delegating:\n1. Ensure the subordinate understands your operational values, priorities, and preferences\n2. Teach the subordinate how the organization works together\n3. Do not allow subordinates to \"pay tuition\" through customer-impacting mistakes\n4. Remember: The supervisor is accountable for teaching these values\n\n### Step 2: Assess Subordinate's TRM for the Specific Task\n\nEvaluate:\n- How much experience does the subordinate have with this specific task?\n- How have they performed on similar tasks previously?\n- Has the task content, environment, or pace changed recently?\n\n### Step 3: Select and Delegate Tasks\n\n**Prerequisite:** Ensure you and the delegatee share a common information base and operational ideas.\n\n**Task Selection Rule:** When given ...",

Sit the subordinate down\n2. Ask why he is quitting\n3. **Let him talk completely**—do not argue, lecture, or panic\n4. Allow him to deliver rehearsed points\n5. Ask more questions to uncover real issues\n6. Convey through actions that he is important to you\n7. **Do not try to change his mind yet**—focus on buying time to prepare for the next round\n\n## Step 2: Supervisor Involvement\n\n1. Go to your supervisor for help and advice\n2. Make the resignation your supervisor's problem\n3. Ensure they participate in the solution\n\n## Step 3: Corporate Citizenship & Solution Pursuit\n\n1. Vigorously pursue every avenue to keep the employee with the firm\n2. This may mean transferring him to another department\n3. Become the project manager of the solution until settled\n\n**Golden Rule:** You owe it to the employer to save an employee for the company (reciprocity among managers).\n\n## Step 4: Presenting the Solution\n\n1. Return with a solution that:\n   - Addresses real reasons for leaving\n   - Benefits the company\n2. Reframe the situation to alleviate fears of being viewed as a \"blackmailer\"\n\n**Key Script:**\n> \"You did not blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway.

Establish Common Base\nUse the meeting to develop a \"common base of information\" and \"similar ways of doing and handling things\" between supervisor and subordinate. This shared base is essential for efficient delegation.\n\n### 3. Facilitate Reverse Teaching\nAllow the subordinate to teach you specific details and data that you may only be vaguely familiar with.

Ponder the data and consider their relationship to other industry indicators to distinguish between:\n- Temporary anomalies (e.g., seasonal slowness)\n- Actual business trends (e.g., business stopped growing)\n\n### 5.

A manager cannot \"do something to another person\" to motivate them directly.\n\n**Manager's Role:** Create an environment in which motivated people can flourish.\n\n### Output vs. Attitude\n\n**Critical Distinction:**\n- Better motivation equals better performance, NOT a change of attitude or feeling\n- A subordinate saying \"I feel motivated\" means nothing\n- Attitude is merely an indicator (a \"window into the black box\"), not the desired result\n- The desired result is better performance at a given skill level\n\n**Focus:** Measure and manage performance, not feelings.\n\n## Worker Type Adaptation\n\n### Manual Laborers\n**Characteristics:**\n- Output is readily measurable\n- Expectations can be stated precisely\n\n**Historical Approach:** Fear of punishment (e.g., loss of life/food) worked effectively\n\n**Management Implication:** Clear metrics and consequences can drive performance\n\n### Knowledge Workers\n**Characteristics:**\n- Output is difficult to measure immediately\n- Expectations are hard to state precisely\n\n**Approach Limitation:** Fear won't work as well (\"fear won't work as well with computer architects as with galley slaves\")\n\n**Required Approach:** Humanistic approaches focused on:\n- Environmental design\n- Intrinsic motivation\n- Self-actualization opportunities\n- Meaningful work\n\n## Management Strategy Framework\n\n### Environmental Design\n1.

Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired.\n\n## Reference Checking Protocol\n\n### Goal\nObtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.\n\n### Build Rapport\n- If you know the reference personally, you have a better chance of getting \"real\" information\n- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond\n- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness\n\n### Timing Strategy\nThe last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond.\n\n## Follow-up Interviews\nIf possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references. Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks.\n\n## Acknowledge Limitations\n- Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success\n- Accept that it merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well\n\n## Output\nHiring decision based on comprehensive assessment and risk acknowledgment.",

    "body": "# Performance Review Processes by Performance Level\n\n## When to Use\n- Conducting a review for a poor performer at risk of termination\n- Conducting a review for a high achiever who could improve further\n- Managing performance turnaround or development conversations\n\n## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process (Poor Performers)\n\nUse when a subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing.\n\n### Identify the Resistance Cycle Stage\n\n1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem\n2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence\n3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others to avoid responsibility\n4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits \"It is my problem\" (emotional step)\n5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation\n\n### Facilitate Progression Through Stages\n\n1. **Ignore → Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality\n2. **Deny → Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance\n3. **Blame Others → Assume Responsibility**: Guide the subordinate to take the \"biggest step\"\n   - This is an emotional step where the subordinate realizes \"If it is my problem, I have to do something about it\"\n4. **Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**: Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task and relatively easier\n\n### Possible Outcomes\n\n1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure\n2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure\n3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit\n\n### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')\n\n1. Assume the formal role of the supervisor endowed with position power\n2. State clearly: \"This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do.\"\n3. Acknowledge disagreement: \"I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right.\"\n4. Assert organizational requirement: \"I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to d...",

    "description": "Delegate work effectively by establishing shared operational values with subordinates, assessing task-relevant maturity (TRM), selecting appropriate tasks to delegate based on familiarity and shared context, and monitoring delegated work using quality assurance principles that adjust frequency based on the subordinate's TRM.",
    "body": "# Effective Delegation Workflow\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n- Preparing to delegate new tasks to subordinates\n- Building delegation capability with a team\n- Monitoring work that has been assigned to others\n- Establishing operational foundations for managerial progression\n\n## Step 1: Establish Shared Operational Values\n\nEffective delegation requires a common understanding of how the organization works together. As a supervisor, you are accountable for your subordinate's output and cannot delegate without shared values.\n\n**Teaching Responsibility:**\n- Transmit common values, priorities, and preferences\n- The responsibility for teaching rests squarely with the supervisor\n- As TRM grows, structure moves from externally imposed to internally adopted\n\n**Prevent \"Customer Tuition\":**\n- Do not allow subordinates to learn by making mistakes paid for by customers (internal or external)\n- Teach correct operational values early on\n\n## Step 2: Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)\n\nTRM is specific to the task, not general competence. It combines:\n- Achievement orientation (drive to succeed)\n- Readiness to take responsibility\n- Education, training, and experience **relevant to the specific task**\n\n**Important:** A person with high general maturity can have low TRM in a new role. TRM can change day by day or hour by hour as conditions change.\n\nDetermine TRM level:\n- **Low:** New to task, environment, or content; rapid pace of work\n- **Medium/Growing:** Gaining experience and familiarity\n- **High:** Experienced, ready to take full responsibility\n\n## Step 3: Select and Delegate Tasks\n\n### Prerequisite Check\nEnsure delegator and delegatee share a **common information base** and operational ideas. Without this, delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage.\n\n### Task Selection Rule\nWhen given a choice, **delegate activities familiar to you rather than unfamiliar ones**. It is easier to monitor tasks you know best.\n\n### Avoid Insincere Delegation\nDo not emotionally hol...",

Apply the \"Life or Death\" Mental Test\nAsk yourself: \"If this person's life depended on doing the work, could he do it?\"\n\n### 2.

Identify Training Needs\n- Create a list of topics subordinates should be trained in\n- Do NOT limit the scope; include:\n  - Simple tasks (e.g., taking calls)\n  - Broad concepts (e.g., objectives, value systems)\n- Ask subordinates what they feel they need to uncover unknown needs\n\n### 2. Resource Inventory and Prioritization\n- Take inventory of available manager-teachers and instructional materials\n- Assign priorities to the items on the training list\n\n### 3. Initial Course Design\n- Start unambitiously with one short course (three to four lectures)\n- Focus on the most urgent subject\n- Be aware that explaining skills you possess is harder than practicing them\n- Avoid the temptation to provide excessive background information that obscures the course objective\n\n### 4. Preparation and Launch\n- Set a schedule with deadlines to prevent getting bogged down\n- Create an outline for the whole course\n- Develop only the first lecture and begin teaching\n\n### 5. Iterative Development\n- Develop the second lecture only after delivering the first\n- Regard the first delivery as a 'throwaway'; accept it will be unsatisfactory\n- **Mitigation Strategy**: Teach the first version to knowledgeable subordinates who can provide interaction and critique without confusion\n\n### 6. Scalability Assessment\n- Determine if you can teach all members personally\n- If many repetitions are needed (e.g., ten or twenty courses), use train-the-trainer model\n- Use the first set of lectures to train a few instructors\n\n### 7. Feedback and Evaluation\n- After the course, request anonymous critiques from employees\n- Use a form prompting for:\n  - Numerical ratings\n  - ...",
