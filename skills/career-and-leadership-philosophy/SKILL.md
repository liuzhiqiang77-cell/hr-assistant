# Career and Leadership Philosophy

## When to Use
- Managing your own career development
- Mentoring employees on career strategy
- Establishing leadership principles
- Facing slow/no-growth environments with ambitious junior employees
- Seeking to build a reputation for operational excellence

## Sole Proprietor Career Mindset

### Adopt the Mindset
- You are not an employee; you are a business with one employee: yourself
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- Fellow workers are not primary rivals; they are outnumbered by people in competing organizations
- Nobody owes you a career; you own it as a sole proprietor

### Execute Daily Career Management
- Continually dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competitive advantage
- Enhance your value every day
- Hone your competitive advantage
- Learn and adapt constantly
- Be willing to move from job to job, or industry to industry if necessary

### The Three Self-Assessment Questions

**Question 1: Value Addition**
- Ask: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"
- Action: Continually look for ways to make things truly better
- Standard: Every hour should be spent increasing the output or value of the people you're responsible for

**Question 2: Connectivity**
- Ask: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?" (inside the company and industry)
- Action: Do not wait for a supervisor to interpret events
- Status: Be a node connected to a network of plugged-in people

**Question 3: Innovation**
- Ask: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"
- Action: Personally try new things; do not just read about them
- Warning: Do not wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace

### Address Internal Threats
In slow/no-growth environments:
- Identify ambitious junior employees who desire upward movement
- Anticipate the boss's dilemma: retaining you vs. promoting the junior
- Take responsibility: avoid being "in the way" (move up or move on)

## Substance Over Style Leadership

### Prioritize Operational Precision
- Focus energy on running the organization with legendary precision
- This precision enables high-confidence decision-making for major investments

### Reject Superficial Self-Promotion
- Do not engage in pretty photo shoots or self-promotion
- Avoid wasting time on appearance if it detracts from core work

### Maintain Authenticity
- Communicate directly; use your own voice
- Articulate lessons so they connect logically and emotionally
- Ensure the audience can understand and feel what you mean

### Embrace Practicality and Humility
- Avoid status symbols like designer suits or power poses
- Embody the role of a worker/manager rather than a distant executive figure
