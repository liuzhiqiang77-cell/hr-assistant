# Reference Checking Guide

## Rapport Building Techniques

### For Known References
- Leverage existing relationship directly
- Reference personal connections and shared experiences
- Appeal to professional courtesy and honesty

### For Unknown References
- Start with casual conversation to establish comfort
- Find common ground:
  - Shared industry experiences
  - Mutual acquaintances
  - Similar professional challenges
- Gradually transition to more specific questions

## Conversation Structure

### First 10 Minutes
- Introduction and context setting
- Casual rapport building
- General questions about the reference's relationship with candidate

### Middle 10 Minutes
- Specific questions about candidate's performance
- Behavioral and situational inquiries
- Strengths and weaknesses assessment

### Final 10 Minutes (Most Valuable)
- Deep-dive into concerns or red flags
- Off-the-record insights
- Would you hire this person again? Why/why not?

## Key Questions to Ask References
1. "In what capacity did you work with the candidate?"
2. "What were the candidate's key responsibilities?"
3. "Can you describe a significant project the candidate worked on?"
4. "What are the candidate's greatest strengths?"
5. "What areas need improvement?"
6. "How did the candidate handle challenges or conflicts?"
7. "Would you hire this person again? Why or why not?"
8. "Is there anything else I should know?"

## Red Flags to Watch For
- Hesitation or evasiveness
- Reluctance to provide specific examples
- Overly generic praise without substance
- Negative tone masked as "constructive feedback"
