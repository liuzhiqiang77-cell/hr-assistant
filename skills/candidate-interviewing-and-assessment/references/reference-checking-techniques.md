# Reference Checking Techniques

## Rapport Building Strategies

### When You Know the Reference Personally
- Leverage existing relationship to get candid information
- Reference will likely be more open and honest
- Can ask more direct questions about performance

### When the Reference is a Stranger
- Keep them on the phone longer than initially planned
- Develop a personal bond through conversation
- Look for common experiences or associations
- Build trust before asking sensitive questions

## Timing Optimization
- **First 10 minutes:** Establish rapport, basic information gathering
- **Middle 10 minutes:** Build connection, find common ground
- **Last 10 minutes:** Most valuable for getting "real" information
- Target at least 30 minutes per reference call

## Information to Seek
- Same information you tried to get from the candidate directly
- Verification of claims made during interview
- Insights into work style and cultural fit
- Performance in past environment
- Areas of strength and weakness

## Limitations to Remember
- References may be hesitant to speak negatively
- Legal constraints on what can be disclosed
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Different environments may yield different results
