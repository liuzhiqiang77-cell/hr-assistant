# Candidate Interviewing and Assessment

## When to Use
- Conducting an interview session with a job candidate
- Planning interview strategy and approach
- Checking references for a candidate
- Conducting follow-up interviews
- Making hiring decisions based on comprehensive assessment

## Prerequisites
- Scheduled interview time
- Candidate resume and background information
- List of references (for reference checking phase)

## Strategic Principles
- **Judge potential contribution** by projecting past performance into the new environment
- **Maintain honesty** - avoid tricks and show the environment as it really is
- **Acknowledge limitations** - careful interviewing increases odds but doesn't guarantee success

## Interview Process

### 1. Ask Specific Assessment Questions

**Projects and Achievements:**
- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

**Self-Awareness and Growth:**
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"

**Fit and Motivation:**
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"

### 2. Categorize Inquiries
Ensure coverage across:
- **Technical/Skills:** Projects, technical weaknesses
- **What They Did With Knowledge:** Past achievements, past failures
- **Discrepancies:** Learning from failures, problem-solving approaches
- **Operational Values:** Readiness for new job, why the company should hire them

### 3. Use Direct Questions
- Ask blunt questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?") to elicit direct answers
- Observe the candidate's reaction and confidence/timidity to gauge actual capability

### 4. Employ Hypothetical Situations
- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps)
- Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result (e.g., finished cost of a wafer)
- Assess their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly

### 5. Invite Candidate Questions
- Ask the candidate what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job
- Analyze their questions to determine what they already know, what they value, and how prepared they are

## Reference Checking

### Goal
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly, but from an external source.

### Build Rapport
- If you know the reference personally, leverage that relationship for more candid information
- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness
- **Timing:** The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond

### Follow-up Interviews
- Talk to the applicant again after checking references, if possible
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks

## Assessment and Decision

### Evaluate Candidate Responses
Analyze across:
- Technical competence and skills
- Problem-solving capacity
- Operational values and fit
- Self-awareness and growth mindset
- Preparation and knowledge about the company

### Make Hiring Decision
- Consider all information from interviews, hypothetical scenarios, and reference checks
- Recognize that careful interviewing increases the odds but doesn't guarantee success
