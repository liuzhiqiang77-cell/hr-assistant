# One-on-One Meeting Protocol

One-on-one meetings are essential for mutual education, information exchange, and relationship building. This protocol covers logistics, content, and interaction dynamics.

## Determine Meeting Frequency

### Base Frequency on Task-Relevant Maturity
- **Low TRM (inexperienced)**: Meet weekly or more frequently
- **High TRM (experienced)**: Meet less frequently (bi-weekly to monthly)

### Adjust for Rate of Change
- **High rate of change** (e.g., Marketing): Increase frequency to stay current
- **Low rate of change** (e.g., Research): Decrease frequency

### Adapt for Large Teams
When managing many direct reports (e.g., 10+) with electronic communication:
- Reduce frequency compared to smaller teams
- Shorten duration
- Focus on coaching and specific issues, not general status updates

## Set Up Logistics

### Duration
- **Minimum**: 1 hour
- **Reasoning**: Anything less causes subordinates to confine discussion to simple things; big problems need time to explore

### Location
- **Preferred**: In or near the subordinate's work area
- **Benefits**: Allows observation of organization, document retrieval efficiency, interruption patterns, and general work approach

### Ownership
- **The meeting is the subordinate's meeting**
- Subordinate sets the agenda and tone
- Subordinate prepares an outline in advance

### Scheduling Method
- Use a **rolling basis**: Set up the next meeting as the current one ends
- **Benefit**: Avoids cancellations from vacations or conflicts that occur with fixed schedules

### Remote/Long-Distance Meetings
- Supervisor must have the outline before the meeting begins
- Exchange notes after the meeting to ensure clarity on commitments

## Manage Content and Interaction

### Content Scope
Cover these types of issues:

1. **Performance figures and indicators**: Incoming order rates, production output, project status (especially indicators signaling trouble)
2. **Events since last meeting**: Hiring problems, people problems, organizational problems, future plans
3. **Potential problems**: Even intangible intuitions that "something is wrong"
4. **Issues that preoccupy the subordinate**: Often obscure and time-consuming concerns

### Supervisor Role: Facilitate and Coach

**Objective**: Facilitate the subordinate's expression of concerns; learn and coach.

**Grove's Principle of Didactic Management**: "Ask one more question!"
- When you think the subordinate is finished, ask another query
- Keep thoughts flowing until the problem's root is reached

### Mechanical Hints

**Note-Taking**:
- Both parties take notes on the outline
- Keeps mind from drifting, aids digestion, forces logical categorization
- Writing down a suggestion implies commitment (like a handshake)

**Hold File**:
- Both parties accumulate important but non-urgent issues
- Applies batching principle to minimize ad hoc interruptions
- Discuss held items at the next scheduled meeting

### Handle Heart-to-Heart Issues

- Encourage discussion of deep work-related problems (satisfaction, frustration, doubts)
- **WARNING**: Beware the "Zinger"—a heart-to-heart issue raised at an awkward time (usually near the end)
- **Risk**: Subordinate drops a major issue (e.g., quitting) with insufficient time to resolve it
- **Prevention**: Reserve time for sensitive topics or ask about them earlier in the meeting
