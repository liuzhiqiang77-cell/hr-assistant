# Promotion and Recycling Procedures

## When to Use
Use when evaluating employees for promotion or dealing with underperformance after promotion. Does not apply to 'noncompetitors' with no motivation to do more.

## Promotion Performance Cycle

### The Cycle Pattern
1. **Initial State:** Employee at Job 1 performing at 'average' level ("meets the requirements")
2. **Improvement:** With training and motivation, performance improves to 'above-average' ("exceeds the requirements")
3. **Promotion Trigger:** Once employee "exceeds the requirements," they are "promotable" and promoted to Job 2
4. **Performance Reset:** Upon entering Job 2, employee initially performs only at "meets requirements" due to new challenges
5. **Cycle Repetition:** With experience, employee again improves to "exceeds requirements," leading to another promotion
6. **Cycle Conclusion:** Cycle repeats until employee settles at "meets requirements" (reaching their "level of incompetence")

### Critical Constraint
If an employee "exceeds the requirements" but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will **atrophy** and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements."

## Employee Recycling Procedure

### When to Recycle
- Employee has been promoted
- Employee performs below-average for extended period
- Employee is "so much over their head" in the new role

### Recycling Process
1. **Identification:** Recognize the person was promoted beyond their capability
2. **Solution Selection:** Choose to "recycle" rather than terminate
3. **Definition:** Put employee back into the job they did well before the promotion
4. **Management Accountability:** Admit management was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness"
5. **Implementation:** Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place person in job they can do
6. **Support System:** Support employee through likely "embarrassment"
7. **Transparency:** Execute recycling "openly" to reduce stigma
8. **Expected Outcome:** Embarrassment will be "short-lived" and employee will regain confidence
9. **Future Value:** Once confidence regained, employee becomes "excellent candidate for another promotion" and likely to succeed

### Prohibited Action
Do NOT force the employee to leave the company. Reject the rationalization that "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake."

## Variables
- **performance_rating** (string): 'meets requirements' or 'exceeds requirements'
- **job_level** (integer): Current tier or difficulty of assigned role
- **performance_duration** (duration): Time spent performing below average in new role
- **previous_role_success** (boolean): Confirmation employee performed well in prior role

## Key Concepts
- **Peter Principle:** People rise to their level of incompetence
- **Atrophy:** Loss of performance when challenges don't grow with capability
