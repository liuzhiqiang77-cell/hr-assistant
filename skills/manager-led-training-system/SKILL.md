# Manager-Led Training System

Training is a high-leverage managerial activity. Managers must personally train subordinates to maximize organizational output and prevent operational failures.

## When to Use
- Increasing organizational output requires performance improvement
- Subordinates lack specific skills or capability
- New employees join the organization
- New organizational skills, principles, or processes need deployment
- Designing a training curriculum or program

## Manager's Training Responsibility

### Core Principle

**A manager's output = the output of his organization—no more, no less**

To increase individual performance, use two principal means:
1. **Increasing motivation** (desire to do the job well)
2. **Increasing capability** (via training)

**Key Insight**: Just as motivation cannot be fully delegated, neither should training be delegated solely to specialists.

### Who Should Train?

**Required Trainer**: The manager (you)
- Train direct subordinates and the next few ranks below them
- Must be a "suitable role model" and "believable, practicing authority"
- **Proxies cannot assume the role**, regardless of subject matter expertise

## High-Leverage Training ROI

### The ROI Calculation

**Preparation Standard**: 3 hours of preparation for every 1 hour of course time

**Example Calculation**:
- Training: 4 lectures × 1 hour = 4 hours course time
- Preparation: 4 hours × 3 = 12 hours manager time
- Students: 10
- Student annual work hours: ~20,000 total (2,000 per person × 10)
- **If training yields 1% improvement**: 200 hours gained
- **ROI**: 200 hours gained ÷ 12 hours invested = **16.7x return**

### Risk of Insufficient Training

Failure to train employees leads to:
- Inefficiencies
- Excess costs
- Unhappy customers
- Danger

**Real Example**: Untrained ion implanter operator caused >$1M in scrapped material and delivery slips.

## Training Strategy and Volume Assessment

### Curriculum Scope Benchmark

Maintain a catalogue of courses covering:
- **Basic skills**: Telephone manners, email protocols
- **Technical skills**: Equipment operation (e.g., ion implanter ~200 hours)
- **Management disciplines**: Strategic planning, "constructive confrontation," performance reviews, productive meetings

**Target allocation**: 2% to 4% of employee time to classroom learning

### Classify Training Tasks

| Task | Purpose | Target Audience |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Task 1 | New Member Training | New employees need skills for their job |
| Task 2 | New Skill Training | Current employees need new ideas/principles/skills |

### Calculate Training Volume

**Task 1 Load (New Members)**:
```
Annual Training Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)
```

**Example**: Department with 10% turnover + 10% growth = **20%** of staff needs training annually

**Task 2 Magnitude (New Skills)**:
```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

**Example**: If Task 1 is 20%, Task 2 is 5 times larger (100% ÷ 20%)

**Implication**: Training all staff (Task 2) is a massive undertaking—enter carefully.

### Cost and Feasibility Assessment

**Calculate cost based on student time**:

**Benchmark**: A one-day course for middle-management staff can cost **>$1,000,000** in student time alone.

**Decision Rule**: Do not enter Task 2 lightly due to high magnitude and cost.

## Training Execution Requirements

### Ensure Cultural Alignment

- Avoid "highly structured and academic" approaches if they contradict company practices
- **Example**: If company tradition is a "free market" where employees apply for jobs on their own initiative, do not teach "carefully coordinated job rotations" or long-term career plans
- **Warning**: Mismatch between teaching and practice demoralizes participants

### Maintain Consistency (Process vs. Event)

- Training must be a **process, not an event**
- Provide a "reliable, consistent presence" that is "systematic and scheduled"
- **Do not use training as a "rescue effort" summoned to solve the problem of the moment**

## Training System Checklist

**Planning**:
- [ ] Manager designated as trainer (not proxies)
- [ ] Curriculum scope defined (basic, technical, management)
- [ ] Task 1 load calculated (Turnover + Growth)
- [ ] Task 2 magnitude assessed (100% ÷ Task 1 Load)
- [ ] ROI calculated (prep hours vs. potential gain)

**Execution**:
- [ ] Training aligned with company culture
- [ ] Systematic schedule established (not one-off events)
- [ ] Preparation ratio: 3:1 (prep hours:course hours)
- [ ] Specific skills tied to operational needs

**Monitoring**:
- [ ] Track performance improvements
- [ ] Verify skills are applied on the job
- [ ] Adjust curriculum based on results
