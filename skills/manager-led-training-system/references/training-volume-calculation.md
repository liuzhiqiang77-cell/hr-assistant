# Training Volume Calculation

## Task 1: New Member Training Formula

```
Annual Training Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)
```

### Examples

| Turnover | Growth | Training Load |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| 5%       | 5%     | 10%           |
| 10%      | 10%    | 20%           |
| 15%      | 5%     | 20%           |
| 20%      | 0%     | 20%           |

## Task 2: New Skill Training Formula

```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

### Examples

| Task 1 Load | Task 2 Magnitude |
|-------------|------------------|
| 10%         | 10x              |
| 20%         | 5x               |
| 25%         | 4x               |
| 33%         | 3x               |

## Cost Estimation

**Benchmark:** A one-day course for middle-management staff can cost over $1,000,000 in student time alone.

**ROI Calculation Example:**
- Preparation: 12 hours (3:1 ratio for 4 hours of course time)
- Students: 10
- Annual work hours per student: 2,000
- Total student hours: 20,000
- Performance improvement: 1%
- Organization gain: 200 hours (1% of 20,000)
- ROI: 200 hours gained / 12 hours invested = 16.7x return
