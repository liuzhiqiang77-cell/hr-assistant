# Cultural Alignment Guidelines

## Principle
Training content must align with company culture. Mismatch between teaching and practice demoralizes participants.

## Example: Free Market Culture

**Company Tradition:**
- Employees apply for jobs on their own initiative
- Minimal structured career planning

**What NOT to Teach:**
- Carefully coordinated job rotations
- Long-term career plans looking ahead several years
- Highly structured and academic approaches

**What TO Teach:**
- Self-driven career development skills
- How to identify and pursue opportunities
- Performance metrics that matter in the current environment

## Risk of Misalignment

When training contradicts daily practice:
1. Participants become cynical
2. Training credibility is lost
3. Manager's authority is undermined
4. Future training initiatives face resistance

## Assessment Checklist

Before finalizing training content:
- [ ] Does this reflect how work actually gets done here?
- [ ] Will participants see this practiced by leadership?
- [ ] Does this align with stated company values?
- [ ] Are there any contradictions with existing processes?
