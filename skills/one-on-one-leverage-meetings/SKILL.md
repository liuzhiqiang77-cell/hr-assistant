# One-on-One Leverage Meetings

## When to Use
- You are a supervisor scheduling or conducting recurring 1-on-1 meetings with direct reports
- You need to establish a common base of information with a subordinate
- You want to enable effective delegation through shared context
- You need to analyze data and indicators together to form congruent conclusions

## Core Procedure

### 1. Calculate Leverage Potential
Recognize that a small time investment (e.g., 1.5 hours) can enhance work quality for a significant duration (e.g., two weeks or 80+ hours) while upgrading your understanding of the subordinate's tasks.

### 2. Establish Common Base
Use the meeting to develop:
- A shared base of information
- Similar ways of doing and handling things

This shared base is essential for efficient and effective delegation.

### 3. Enable Reverse Teaching
Allow the subordinate to teach you specific details and data you may only be vaguely familiar with. This information is absolutely essential for making good decisions.

### 4. Joint Data Analysis
Review specific indicators together (e.g., trend indicators of incoming orders):
- Ponder the data
- Consider relationships to other industry indicators
- Distinguish between temporary anomalies (e.g., seasonal slowness) and actual business trends (e.g., business stopped growing)

### 5. Formulate Congruent Conclusions
Develop a congruent attitude, approach, and conclusion based on shared analysis.

**Example**: Deciding to take a "conservative approach to near-term investment" rather than assuming growth.

### 6. Execute Cascading Actions
- **Subordinate**: Implements decisions in their specific area of responsibility (e.g., scale back growth)
- **Supervisor**: Shares conclusions with other business groups or managers, multiplying the leverage across the organization

## Key Variables
- **meeting_duration**: Length of the session (typically 1.5 hours)
- **impact_duration**: Period of enhanced work quality (typically two weeks)
- **information_base**: Shared understanding and context between supervisor and subordinate

## Constraints
- Requires willingness to share information openly
- Requires time investment from supervisor
- Both parties must commit to regular scheduled meetings (e.g., every two weeks)
