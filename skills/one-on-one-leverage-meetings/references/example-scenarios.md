# Example Scenarios

## Intel Sales Manager Case

A sales manager uses trend indicators to convince their supervisor of a business slowdown. Through the 1:1 meeting:

1. They review incoming order trend indicators together
2. They distinguish seasonal slowness from actual business trends
3. They conclude business has stopped growing
4. They adopt a conservative approach to near-term investment
5. The supervisor scales back growth plans
6. The conclusion is shared across other business groups

This single 1.5-hour meeting influences decisions across multiple business units for two weeks.
