# Performance Diagnosis Scenarios

## Scenario 1: The Struggling New Hire

**Situation:** New engineer consistently missing deadlines on coding tasks.

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Do they understand the requirements? (Capability)
- Do they know the language/framework? (Capability)
- Are they putting in the hours? (Motivation)
- Do they seem engaged? (Motivation)

**Root Cause:** Capability—they don't know the internal systems well enough yet.

**Intervention:** Training
- Pair programming with senior engineer
- Documentation of internal systems
- Structured onboarding plan

## Scenario 2: The Capable But Unengaged Veteran

**Situation:** Senior salesperson knows the product perfectly but has declining sales numbers.

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Do they have the skills? Yes (proven track record)
- Are they putting in effort? No (minimal prospecting)
- Do they seem burned out? Possibly

**Root Cause:** Motivation—they have the capability but not the drive.

**Intervention:** Motivation
- Commission structure adjustment
- New territory assignment
- Career path discussion
- Recognition program

## Scenario 3: The Ambitious Junior

**Situation:** Junior employee wants more responsibility but makes mistakes on complex tasks.

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Do they have the technical skills? Partially (learning)
- Are they motivated? Highly (proactive, asks for work)

**Root Cause:** Capability—they have motivation but not yet full capability.

**Intervention:** Training with Motivation
- Assign challenging projects with mentorship
- Incremental responsibility increases
- Recognize and reward effort while building skills

## Scenario 4: The Checking-Out Mid-Career Employee

**Situation:** Previously high performer now doing minimum work, unresponsive to feedback.

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Do they have the skills? Yes (proven capability)
- Are they motivated? No (disengaged, resistant)

**Root Cause:** Motivation—capability is intact, motivation is gone.

**Intervention:** Motivation (or Exit)
- Direct conversation about concerns
- Performance improvement plan
- If no improvement—termination may be necessary

## Common Mistakes in Diagnosis

1. **Assuming "Can't" when it's "Won't":** Offering training to someone who simply doesn't care
2. **Assuming "Won't" when it's "Can't":** Trying to motivate someone who genuinely lacks the skills
3. **Ignoring the third option:** Sometimes the answer is "won't and can't"—termination is appropriate
4. **Rushing to judgment:** Take time to observe and gather evidence before diagnosing
