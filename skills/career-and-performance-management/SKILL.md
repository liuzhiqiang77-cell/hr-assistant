# Career and Performance Management

## When to Use
- Managing your own career development
- Mentoring employees on career growth
- Diagnosing underperformance
- Developing performance improvement plans
- Facing slow or no-growth environments

## Sole Proprietor Career Mindset

### Core Concept
You are not an employee; you are a business with one employee: yourself.

### Adopt the Mindset

**Recognize Your Competition:**
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- Fellow workers are not primary rivals
- Ratios may be 1,000:1, 100,000:1, or 1,000,000:1 against people in competing organizations

**Key Principle:**
"Nobody owes you a career—you own it as a sole proprietor."

### Daily Career Management Actions

**Enhance Your Value:**
- Dedicate yourself to retaining individual competitive advantage
- Enhance your value every day
- Hone your competitive advantage continuously

**Learn and Adapt:**
- Learn constantly
- Be willing to move from job to job
- Be willing to change industries if necessary
- Retrench and start again if needed

**Goal:** Manage your career to avoid becoming a casualty of globalization and the information revolution.

### Address Internal Threats (Slow/No-Growth Environments)

**Identify the Threat:**
- Ambitious junior employees desiring upward movement
- You may be blocking their path

**Anticipate the Boss's Dilemma:**
- Choosing between retaining you (doing good work but blocking others)
- Or promoting the junior

**Take Responsibility:**
- Avoid being "in the way"
- Move up or move on

## Self-Assessment Protocol (The 3 Questions)

### Question 1: Value Addition
**Ask:** "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"

**Actions:**
- Continually look for ways to make things truly better
- Every hour should be spent increasing output or value of output
- Remember: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization"

### Question 2: Connectivity
**Ask:** "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"

**Check:**
- Inside the company
- Within the industry
- Do not wait for a supervisor to interpret events
- Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people"

### Question 3: Innovation
**Ask:** "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"

**Actions:**
- Personally try new things; do not just read about them
- Do not wait for others to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of it

## Employee Performance Diagnosis

### The Diagnostic Framework

When an employee is not performing their job, determine the root cause:

**Can't Do It → Capability Issue → Train**
- The employee lacks the knowledge, skills, or ability
- Solution: Provide training, coaching, resources

**Won't Do It → Motivation Issue → Motivate**
- The employee has the ability but lacks the drive or willingness
- Solution: Provide motivation, incentives, consequences

### Critical Constraint
There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than:
1. Motivate
2. Train

### Diagnosis Process

1. **Identify the gap:** Employee is not meeting expectations
2. **Determine the cause:** Is it "can't" or "won't"?
3. **Select the intervention:**
   - "Can't" → Training
   - "Won't" → Motivation
4. **Implement and monitor:** Apply the intervention and track results

## Performance Improvement Checklist

**For Self:**
- [ ] Am I adding real value daily?
- [ ] Am I plugged into what's happening around me?

- [ ] Is my competitive advantage growing?

**For Employees:**
- [ ] Is this a capability issue (can't) or motivation issue (won't)?
