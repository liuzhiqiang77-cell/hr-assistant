# Managerial Motivation Strategies

Use this skill to design environments and implement systems that motivate employees and drive peak performance.

## When to Use

- Manager needs to improve team or individual output
- Root cause of performance issues is motivation (not capability)
- Managing knowledge workers where output is difficult to measure
- Seeking peak performance from high-potential employees
- Implementing Management by Objectives (MBO) systems
- Building a culture that values achievement

## Core Principles

### The Nature of Motivation
- Motivation must come from within the individual
- A manager cannot "do something to another person" to motivate them directly
- The manager's role is to create an environment in which motivated people can flourish

### Output vs. Attitude
- Better motivation equals better performance, NOT a change of attitude or feeling
- Attitude is merely an indicator (a "window into the black box"), not the desired result
- The desired result is better performance at a given skill level

### Contextual Approach
- **Manual Labor**: Output is readily measurable; fear of punishment historically worked well
- **Knowledge Workers**: Output is difficult to measure; expectations are hard to state precisely. Fear won't work as well. New humanistic approaches are needed.

## Strategy 1: Environmental Design

### Create the Right Environment
1. Identify what motivates your team members (use Maslow analysis)
2. Design the work environment to support those motivators
3. Remove barriers to motivated performance
4. Provide resources and support for motivated individuals

### Focus on Performance Measurement
- Define clear, measurable outputs
- Establish expectations in advance
- Track performance against standards
- Use attitude as an indicator, not a target

## Strategy 2: Peak Performance Management (Self-Actualization)

### Understand the Driver Type
Identify whether the employee is:
- **Competence-Driven**: Focus on job or task mastery; sharpening skills
- **Achievement-Driven**: Focus on testing limits; working at the "boundary of capability"

### Implement MBO (Management by Objectives)
1. Set objectives at a difficulty level where the individual has only a "fifty-fifty chance" of success, even if they push hard
2. Rationale: Output tends to be greater when striving for a level beyond immediate grasp
3. Objective: Achieve peak performance from self and subordinates

### Build an Output-Centered Culture
- Create an environment that "values and emphasizes output"
- Avoid "knowledge-centered" cultures where knowing abstractly is valued over producing results
- Adopt "output-centered" values: Tangible results are highly valued and esteemed
- Abstract knowledge without application gets little recognition

## Strategy 3: Competitive Sports Approach

### Establish the "Racetrack" (Arena of Competition)
1. Create clear "rules of the game" for the work environment
2. Implement specific metrics or scores that allow employees to measure themselves against peers
3. Example: Assign a "building czar" to score facility maintenance and compare scores across buildings

### Define the Manager's Role as "The Coach"
1. Take NO personal credit for the team's success to build trust
2. Be tough and critical to push team members to their "personal best"
3. Steer employees away from irrelevant rewards (e.g., office size) toward task-relevant feedback

### Manage Fear and Failure
1. Recognize that fear shifts from "loss of job" to "fear of failure" in competitive modes
2. Allow fear of failure to spur performance (positive)
3. Prevent it from becoming a preoccupation that causes conservative risk-avoidance (negative)
4. Normalize failure: Losing is a statistical probability (e.g., 50% of matches) and not a reason to quit

### Maintain the Competitive Environment
- Monitor for the removal of competition (e.g., mergers), which causes motivation to vanish
- Ensure the "game" remains active to sustain self-sustaining motivation

## Procedure

### Step 1: Diagnose the Situation
- What type of workers are you managing? (manual labor vs knowledge workers)
- What is the current performance level?
- What are the barriers to motivation?

### Step 2: Select the Appropriate Strategy
- Use Environmental Design for foundational motivation issues
- Use Peak Performance Management for high-potential employees
- Use Competitive Sports Approach for teams that respond well to competition

### Step 3: Implement the Strategy
- Follow the specific steps for the chosen strategy
- Set clear expectations and metrics
- Monitor progress and adjust as needed

### Step 4: Evaluate Results
- Measure output improvements
- Assess whether motivation has increased
- Adjust strategy based on results

## Key Considerations

- **One size does not fit all**: Different strategies work for different people and situations
- **Culture matters**: The organizational culture must support the chosen strategy
- **Measurement is critical**: You cannot improve what you do not measure
- **Sustainability**: Consider whether the motivation approach is sustainable long-term

## Output

A management framework utilizing environmental design, goal setting, cultural alignment, and/or competitive principles to maximize employee performance.
