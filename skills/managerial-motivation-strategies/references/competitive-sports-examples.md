# Competitive Sports Approach - Examples and Applications

## Example 1: Facility Maintenance Competition

**Scenario**: Multiple buildings in a corporate campus have inconsistent maintenance quality.

**Implementation**:
- Assign a "building czar" to each building
- Create a scoring system for maintenance quality (cleanliness, repairs, responsiveness)
- Post scores weekly in a visible location
- Compare scores across buildings

**Result**: Immediate improvement in maintenance quality without monetary rewards. The competitive element and visibility of scores motivated the building czars.

## Example 2: Sales Team Performance

**Scenario**: Sales team performance is stagnant; team members are complacent.

**Implementation**:
- Create a "leaderboard" showing sales figures for each team member
- Establish clear rules for how sales are counted and credited
- Manager acts as coach: provides feedback, helps with strategy, doesn't take credit
- Celebrate wins publicly, analyze losses constructively

**Result**: Increased sales activity, healthy competition, team members pushing each other to improve.

## When Competitive Approach Works Best

- Tasks have clear, measurable outputs
- Team members have similar skill levels
- Culture accepts feedback and constructive criticism
- Competition can be kept friendly and productive

## When to Avoid Competitive Approach

- Tasks require deep collaboration rather than individual performance
- Team members have vastly different skill levels
- Competition has led to destructive behavior in the past
- Work is already highly stressful or high-stakes
