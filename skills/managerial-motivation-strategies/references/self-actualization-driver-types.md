# Self-Actualization Driver Types

## Competence-Driven

**Focus:** Job or task mastery

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- Sharpening own skill continuously
- Trying to do better than the time before
- Focused on personal improvement benchmarks
- Engaged in deliberate practice

**Examples:**
- A violinist practicing daily to perfect technique
- A programmer refactoring code for elegance
- A craftsman obsessing over details

**Management Approach:**
- Provide opportunities for skill development
- Offer progressively challenging tasks within domain
- Recognize mastery and technical excellence
- Allow time for practice and experimentation

## Achievement-Driven

**Focus:** Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- Testing the limits of capability
- Working at the "boundary of their capability"
- Seeking challenges that may result in failure
- Driven by accomplishment across domains

**The Peg/Ring Experiment Classification:**

**Gamblers:**
- High risk, no influence on outcome
- Not true achievers
- Motivated by thrill, not achievement

**Conservatives:**
- Very little risk
- Avoid failure at all costs
- Not true achievers

**Achievers:**
- Challenge themselves at the boundary of capability
- Accept 50% failure rate as acceptable
- Test limits through calculated risk

**Examples:**
- An entrepreneur starting multiple ventures
- A salesperson pursuing stretch quotas
- An athlete competing at increasingly higher levels

**Management Approach:**
- Set goals at 50% success probability
- Provide stretch assignments
- Celebrate both successes and learning from failures
- Create competitive benchmarks

## Common Characteristics

Both types spontaneously try to test the outer limits of their abilities. The key difference is the domain of focus (task mastery vs. general achievement).

## Identifying Driver Type

**Ask:**
1. Does the person focus on getting better at specific skills? (Competence)
2. Does the person seek achievement across various domains? (Achievement)
3. How do they respond to failure? (Learning vs. setback)
4. What type of challenges do they seek? (Skill refinement vs. boundary testing)
