# Training Volume Calculator

## Step 1: Determine Annual Turnover Rate

Calculate the percentage of staff leaving annually:

```
Turnover Rate = (Number of Departures ÷ Average Staff Count) × 100
```

**Examples**:
- Company of 100 people, 10 people left in a year: 10% turnover
- Department of 50 people, 8 people left in a year: 16% turnover

---

## Step 2: Determine Annual Growth Rate

Calculate the percentage increase in staffing:

```
Growth Rate = ((Ending Staff Count - Starting Staff Count) ÷ Starting Staff Count) × 100
```

**Examples**:
- Company grew from 100 to 110 employees: 10% growth
- Department grew from 50 to 60 employees: 20% growth

---

## Step 3: Calculate Task 1 Training Load

```
Task 1 Load = Turnover Rate + Growth Rate
```

### Example Calculations

| Scenario | Turnover | Growth | Task 1 Load |
|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Stable company | 5% | 5% | 10% |
| High-growth startup | 20% | 50% | 70% |
| Declining company | 15% | -5% | 10% |
| Typical enterprise | 10% | 10% | 20% |

---

## Step 4: Calculate Task 2 Magnitude

```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% ÷ Task 1 Load
```

### Example Calculations

| Task 1 Load | Task 2 Magnitude | Interpretation |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| 10% | 10x | Training all staff is 10x the effort of training new hires |
| 20% | 5x | Training all staff is 5x the effort |
| 50% | 2x | Training all staff is 2x the effort |
| 70% | 1.4x | Training all staff is only 40% more effort |

## Step 5: Cost Implications

### Student Time Cost Formula

```
Student Time Cost = Number of Students × Course Duration (hours) × Fully Loaded Hourly Cost
```

**Example**: One-day course for 50 middle managers
```
50 students × 8 hours × $250/hour = $100,000 in student time
```

### Fully Loaded Hourly Cost Components
- Salary ÷ 2,080 (annual work hours)
- Benefits (typically 20-30% of salary)
- Overhead allocation (office space, equipment, admin support)
- Opportunity cost (value of what they would otherwise produce)

**Benchmark**: A middle manager earning $150,000/year may have a fully loaded cost of $250-300/hour.

---

## Decision Framework

```
IF Task 1 Load > 30%:
    THEN New member training is a major organizational commitment
    AND Consider dedicated training resources
    
IF Task 2 Magnitude > 5x:
    THEN Training all staff requires significant justification
    AND Require clear business case and expected ROI
    
IF Proposed Training ROI < 3x:
    THEN Reconsider or redesign the training
    AND Focus on higher-leverage topics
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Intel Corporation (Benchmarks from Source)

**Scale**: Large semiconductor company
**University Catalogue**: 50+ classes
**Allocation**: 2-4% of employee time to classroom learning
**Example Complex Course**: Ion implanter operation (~200 hours of training)

### Example 2: High-Turnover Retail Chain

**Turnover**: 60% annually
**Growth**: 10% annually
**Task 1 Load**: 70%
**Implication**: More than 2/3 of staff need basic training each year
**Solution**: Dedicated onboarding program, standardized training materials, full-time trainers

### Example 3: Stable Government Agency

**Turnover**: 5% annually
**Growth**: 0% annually
**Task 1 Load**: 5%
**Task 2 Magnitude**: 20x
**Implication**: Training new staff is minimal; training all staff is 20x more effort
**Solution**: Careful selection of Task 2 initiatives; focus only on highest-impact skills
