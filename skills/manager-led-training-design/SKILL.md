# Manager-Led Training Design

A manager's output is the output of their organization. Training is a high-leverage activity to increase organizational output through systematic skill development.

## When to Use
- Subordinates lack specific skills or capability
- You need to increase organizational output
- New employees join the organization
- New organizational skills or principles need to be introduced
- Performance improvement requires capability building

## Core Principle: Manager as Trainer

**The manager must instruct direct subordinates and the next few ranks below them.**

**Rationale**: Training must be performed by a "suitable role model" who is a "believable, practicing authority." Proxies, regardless of subject matter expertise, cannot fill this role effectively.

## Training ROI Calculation

### The High-Leverage Formula

```
Preparation Time: 3 hours per 1 hour of course time

Example:
- 4 lectures × 1 hour each = 4 hours course time
- Manager preparation: 4 × 3 = 12 hours
- Students: 10
- Student annual work hours: 20,000 total
- If training yields 1% improvement: 200 hours gained
- ROI: 200 hours gained ÷ 12 hours invested = 16.7x return
```

### Key Insight

Small improvements in many people create enormous organizational impact. A 1% improvement across 10 people working 2,000 hours each = 200 hours gained.

## Determine Training Volume

### Training Task Classification

| Task | Who | Scope |
|------|-----|-------|
| Task 1 | New members | Skills needed for current job |
| Task 2 | Present members | New ideas, principles, skills |

### Calculate Task 1 Volume (New Members)

```
Annual Training Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)
```

**Example**: A department with 10% turnover and 10% growth must train 20% of staff annually.

### Calculate Task 2 Volume (New Skills)

```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

**Example**: If Task 1 load is 20%, Task 2 is 5 times larger (100% ÷ 20% = 5x)

> **Warning**: Training 100% of staff is expensive. A one-day course for middle-management staff can cost over $1,000,000 in student time alone. Do not enter Task 2 lightly.

## Design Requirements

### 1. Cultural Alignment

Training content must align with company culture:

**Example of Mismatch**:
- Company culture: "Free market" where employees apply for jobs on their own initiative
- Training content: "Carefully coordinated job rotations" and long-term career plans
- **Result**: Mismatch between teaching and practice demoralizes participants

### 2. Consistency Over Events

Training must be a **process, not an event**:
- Provide a "reliable, consistent presence"
- Make it "systematic and scheduled"
- Do NOT use training as a "rescue effort" to solve the problem of the moment

### 3. Practical Application

Training must be tied to practice:
- Avoid "highly structured and academic" approaches if they contradict company practices
- Teach skills that employees can apply immediately
- Include real-world examples from your organization

## Training Curriculum Scope

Maintain a catalogue of courses covering:
- Basic skills (e.g., telephone manners)
- Technical skills (e.g., equipment operation)
- Management disciplines (e.g., strategic planning, performance reviews, productive meetings)

**Benchmark**: Allocate approximately 2% to 4% of employee time to classroom learning.
