description: Apply specialized performance review processes for poor performers requiring turnaround (Blast process) and high achievers needing continued development. Use when an employee has major performance problems or is a high performer requiring future-oriented guidance.

# Performance Review for Different Performance Levels

## When to Use This Skill
- A subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing
- A subordinate is a high achiever who needs future-oriented development guidance
- You need to move beyond standard review processes for exceptional situations

## The 'Blast' Process for Poor Performers

### Prerequisites
- Manager possesses facts and examples
- Subordinate is at risk of termination unless performance improves

### Identify the Resistance Cycle
Track the subordinate's current stage:

1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others to avoid responsibility
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation

### Facilitate Progression Through Stages

**From Ignore to Deny:**
- Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality

**From Deny to Blame Others:**
- Use evidence to overcome resistance

**From Blame Others to Assume Responsibility:**
- Guide the subordinate to take the "biggest step"
- This is an **emotional step** where they realize: "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
- This implies work and unpleasantness

**From Assume Responsibility to Find Solution:**
- Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task
- This is an **intellectual step** and relatively easier

### Possible Outcomes
1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')
1. Assume the formal role of supervisor with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. Secure the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### Recognize the Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying the judgment of superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better.

### Contrast with Poor Performers
- Poor performers receive detailed "corrective action programs" (step-by-step affairs to meet minimum requirements)
- High achievers often lack future-oriented guidance

### Shift the Priority
1. Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to improve performance
2. Define specific actions to maintain current high performance level
3. Focus on future development, not just retrospective assessment

### Rationale
- High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work
- Improving them is a **high-leverage activity**
- The impact on group output is very great

## Key Distinction: Emotional vs. Intellectual Steps
- **Assuming Responsibility** is an emotional step (hard)
- **Finding Solution** is an intellectual step (easier)

Understanding this helps managers be patient and supportive during the critical responsibility-assumption phase.
