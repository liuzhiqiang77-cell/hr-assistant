# Individual Career Management

## When to Use This Skill
- Seeking employment or career advancement
- Concerned about job security in changing economic environment
- Feeling stuck or blocked in current position
- Planning career transitions
- Assessing personal competitive advantage
- Working in slow/no-growth environments with ambitious juniors

## The Sole Proprietor Mindset

### Core Concept
You are not an employee; you are a business with one employee: yourself.

### Key Realizations

1. **Global Competition**: You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
2. **Rival Identification**: Fellow workers are not primary rivals; they are outnumbered (ratios of 1000:1, 100,000:1, or 1,000,000:1) by people working for competing organizations
3. **Ownership**: "Nobody owes you a career"; you own it as a sole proprietor

## Daily Career Management Actions

### Continuous Value Enhancement
- Dedicate yourself daily to retaining individual competitive advantage
- Enhance your value every day
- Hone your competitive advantage
- Learn and adapt constantly

### Mobility and Adaptability
- Be willing to move from job to job
- Be willing to move from industry to industry
- Be willing to retrench and start again if necessary

### Goal
Manage your career to avoid becoming a casualty of globalization and the information revolution.

## Addressing Internal Threats

### The Threat Profile
- **Environment**: Slow or no-growth organization
- **Source**: Ambitious junior employees seeking upward movement
- **Blockage**: Your position blocks their advancement

### The Boss's Dilemma
Choosing between:
- Retaining you (doing a good job but blocking others)
- Promoting the junior (addressing talent development)

### Taking Responsibility
Avoid being "in the way":
- Move up (seek promotion)
- Move on (find new position)

## The Self-Assessment Protocol

### Question 1: Value Addition
**Ask**: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"

**Action**:
- Continually look for ways to make things truly better in your department
- Apply the principle: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization"
- Standard: Every hour should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of people you're responsible for

### Question 2: Connectivity
**Ask**: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"

**Check**:
- Inside the company
- In the industry
- Do not wait for supervisor to interpret events

**Status**: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people" rather than "floating by yourself"

### Question 3: Innovation
**Ask**: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"

**Action**:
- Personally try new things; do not just read about them
- Experiment and learn

**Warning**: Do not wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of that workplace
