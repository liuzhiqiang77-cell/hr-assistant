# Delegation Strategy Examples

## Example 1: Successful Delegation

**Task**: Prepare monthly department budget report

**Pre-Delegation Assessment**:
- Common information base: Yes (subordinate knows budget process)
- Task familiarity: High (manager has done this many times)
- Development value: Medium (routine but important)

**Delegation Process**:
1. Manager explains outcome: "Accurate budget report by 5th of each month"
2. Clarifies authority: "You can approve expenses under $500, anything higher comes to me"
3. Sets checkpoints: "Check in on 25th if you have questions"
4. Provides support: "Last three months' reports are in the shared folder"

**Follow-Through**:
- Manager reviews draft on 3rd
- Provides feedback on formatting
- Subordinate submits final report on 5th

**Result**: High leverage, subordinate developed, manager freed 4 hours/month

## Example 2: Delegation Failure (No Common Base)

**Task**: Handle customer complaint about new product feature

**Pre-Delegation Assessment**:
- Common information base: No (subordinate doesn't know product history or customer context)
- Task familiarity: Medium
- Development value: High

**Attempted Delegation**:
- Manager assigns task: "Handle this customer complaint"
- No context provided
- No authority boundaries set

**Result**:
- Subordinate makes承诺s that can't be kept
- Customer escalates to VP
- Manager must intervene and fix damage
- **Leverage**: Negative (created more work)

**Correct Approach**:
1. Brief subordinate on product history and customer relationship
2. Explain what can and cannot be promised
3. Set authority boundaries
4. Then delegate

## Example 3: Insincere Delegation (Pencil Experiment)

**Task**: Prepare presentation for board meeting

**Manager's Thinking**: "I'll delegate this to Sarah, but I really enjoy doing presentations so I'll probably end up doing most of it myself."

**What Happens**:
- Manager assigns task to Sarah
- Manager "checks in" daily, essentially taking over
- Sarah feels undermined, stops taking initiative
- Manager does 80% of work
- Sarah learns nothing
- **Leverage**: Negative (wasted Sarah's time, manager did work anyway)

**Correct Approach**:
- Option A: Keep the task, be honest about wanting to do it
- Option B: Truly delegate, let Sarah own it, provide support only

## Example 4: Abdication (No Follow-Through)

**Task**: Lead cross-functional project team

**Delegation**:
- Manager assigns project to senior engineer
- Says: "You own this, let me know if you need anything"
- No checkpoints established
- No progress reviews scheduled

**What Happens**:
- Project goes off track
- Team conflicts arise
- Deadlines missed
- Manager discovers problems only when it's too late
- **Result**: Project failure, team morale damaged

**Correct Approach**:
- Establish weekly status meetings
- Review milestones at each checkpoint
- Be available for guidance and obstacle removal
- Remain engaged without micromanaging

## Example 5: Reverse Delegation

**Task**: Resolve scheduling conflict between two departments

**Delegation**:
- Manager assigns to administrative assistant

**What Happens**:
- Assistant comes back: "They can't agree, what should I do?"
- Manager solves the problem
- Assistant learns to bring problems to manager
- **Result**: Manager still doing the work

**Correct Approach**:
- Assistant: "They can't agree. Here are three possible solutions: A, B, or C. I recommend B because..."
- Manager: "Go with B, good analysis"
- Assistant learns problem-solving

## Monitoring Guidelines

| Task Complexity | Checkpoint Frequency |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Routine, well-understood | Weekly or completion only |
| Moderate complexity | Twice weekly |
| High complexity or high stakes | Daily or every other day |
| New delegatee | More frequent initially |
| Experienced, trusted delegatee | Less frequent |

## Delegation Decision Matrix

```
                    | High Familiarity | Low Familiarity
--------------------|------------------|------------------
High Common Base    | Delegate freely  | Delegate with   |
                    |                  | support         |
--------------------|------------------|------------------
Low Common Base     | Build base first | Do not delegate |
                    | then delegate    |                  |
--------------------|------------------|------------------
