# Delegation Strategy

Use this skill when a manager needs to free up time or assign work.

## Prerequisite Check

Ensure the 'delegator' and 'delegatee' share a common information base and operational ideas. Without this, delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage.

## Avoid Insincere Delegation

Do not emotionally hold onto tasks while pretending to delegate (the 'pencil experiment'). If you keep a task because you enjoy it, make it a conscious decision rather than a charade.

## Task Selection Rule

When given a choice, delegate activities that are familiar to you rather than unfamiliar ones.

### Reasoning
It is easier to monitor tasks you know best.

## Responsibility Principle

'Delegation without follow-through is abdication.' You never wash your hands of the task; you remain responsible for its accomplishment.

## Variables
- **Common Information Base**: Shared understanding and context between manager and subordinate
- **Task Familiarity**: How well the manager knows the specific task being delegated

## Result
Select familiar tasks to delegate, ensure common context, and retain responsibility for the outcome.
