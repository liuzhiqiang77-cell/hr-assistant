# Intel Sales Manager Example

**Scenario**: A sales manager uses one-on-one meetings to provide strategic intelligence to their supervisor.

**Process**:
1. Sales manager presents trend indicators showing business slowdown
2. Together, they analyze data against broader industry indicators
3. They distinguish seasonal factors from actual business trends
4. They formulate a congruent conclusion: conservative approach to near-term investment
5. Supervisor cascades this conclusion to other business groups

**Outcome**: Scaled operational plans and strategic alignment across the organization based on data-driven insight from the one-on-one discussion.

## Leverage Multiplication

The single 1.5-hour meeting:
- Directly affects the subordinate's work for 80+ hours
- Informs the supervisor's decisions affecting multiple teams
- Cascades to other business units through supervisor communication
- Creates organization-wide strategic alignment from granular data
