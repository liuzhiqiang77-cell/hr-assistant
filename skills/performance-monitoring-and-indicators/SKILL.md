# Performance Monitoring and Indicators

This skill provides frameworks for designing effective performance metrics, monitoring daily operations, tracking progress, and forecasting business trends.

## When to Use
- Starting daily operations or arriving at the office
- Designing or selecting performance metrics for a team or process
- Tracking progress toward monthly or quarterly goals
- Forecasting future business trends and monitoring accuracy
- Identifying early warning signs of performance issues
- Creating balanced scorecards or dashboards

## Daily Operational Indicator Set

Review these indicators every day to maintain operational health.

### 1. Sales Forecast
- **Check**: Number of units planned for delivery today
- **Action**: Align resources to meet forecast

### 2. Variance Analysis
- **Check**: Yesterday's actual vs. planned deliveries
- **Purpose**: Assess confidence in today's forecast
- **Action**: Adjust plans if variance is significant

### 3. Raw Material Inventory
- **Check**: Stock levels of essential items
- **If too low**: Order more supplies immediately
- **If too high**: Cancel scheduled deliveries

### 4. Equipment Condition
- **Check**: Any equipment breakdowns yesterday
- **If breakdown occurred**: Arrange repairs or rearrange production line

### 5. Manpower Status
- **Check**: Staff availability (sick leave, vacancies)
- **If understaffed**: Call temporary help OR reallocate from other lines

### 6. Quality Indicator
- **Check**: Customer complaint log
- **If high complaints**: Address with specific staff member immediately

## Design Effective Indicators

### Core Principles

**Attention Principle**: Indicators direct attention like steering a bicycle—you steer where you look.

**Guard Against Overreaction**: Focusing on a single metric can lead to extreme behaviors.

**Implement Paired Indicators**: Always pair indicators to measure both effect and counter-effect.

### Administrative Indicator Criteria

1. **Any measurement is better than none**
2. **Measure Output (results), not Activity (effort)**
   - Good: Orders obtained, vouchers processed
   - Bad: Calls made, hours worked
3. **Measure Physical/Countable things**
   - Examples: Vouchers processed, square feet cleaned, sales orders entered, transactions processed, people hired

### Paired Indicator Strategy

Pair Quantity/Output with Quality indicators:

| Domain | Quantity Metric | Quality Metric |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Inventory | Inventory Level | Incidence of Shortages |
| Project Management | Completion Date | Capability/Quality |
| Accounts Payable | # Vouchers processed | # Errors found |
| Custodial | # Square feet cleaned | Quality rating |
| Sales | # Orders obtained | Customer satisfaction |

## Use Linearity Indicators

Track progress toward deadlines to identify early warning signs.

### Procedure
1. **Plot actual output** against time elapsed
2. **Define ideal straight line**: Linear trajectory from start to target
3. **Compare actual vs. ideal**
4. **Take corrective action** if deviation is significant

### Interpretation

**Below the line**: Need higher rate in remaining period to hit target
- **Action**: Accelerate performance, add resources

**Back-loaded (concentrated at end)**: Inefficient resource use
- **Action**: Address resource allocation to prevent breakdown risks

**Purpose**: Provides early warning to allow corrective action before deadline.

## Create Stagger Charts for Forecasting

Track forecast evolution to understand business trends and improve accuracy.

### Structure
- **Rows**: Month the forecast was made
- **Columns**: Future months being forecasted

### Procedure
1. **Initial Forecast**: In first month, fill forecasts for all future months
2. **Update Monthly**: Create new row each month with updated forecasts
3. **Analyze Variations**: Compare forecasts for same target month made at different times
4. **Interpret Trends**: Significant variation indicates changing business conditions

### Benefits
- Shows evolution of expectations over time
- Forces forecasters to take task seriously (past forecasts compared to actuals)
- More valuable indicator than simple trend charts

## Workflow

1. **Design your indicator set** using paired metrics principle
2. **Establish daily review routine** using the 6-point checklist
3. **Implement linearity tracking** for all goal-oriented work
4. **Create stagger charts** for forecasting and trend analysis
5. **Review indicators regularly** and take corrective action
6. **Refine metrics** based on what behaviors they drive
