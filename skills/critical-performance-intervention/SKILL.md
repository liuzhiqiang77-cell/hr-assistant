# Critical Performance Intervention (The 'Blast' Process)

## When to Use
- Subordinate has a major performance problem
- Turnaround is required to avoid termination
- Employee is stuck in denial or blame cycles
- Previous feedback attempts have failed

## The Resistance Cycle

Employees progress through these stages when facing serious performance issues:

| Stage | Behavior | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Ignore | Passive ignoring of the problem |
| 2 | Deny | Active denial of the problem's existence |
| 3 | Blame Others | Admits problem exists but blames others |
| 4 | Assume Responsibility | Admits "It is my problem" |
| 5 | Find Solution | Intellectual step to remedy the situation |

## Step 1: Identify Current Stage
Determine where the subordinate is in the resistance cycle.

## Step 2: Facilitate Progression

### Moving from Ignore → Deny
- Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
- Present objective evidence of the performance gap

### Moving from Deny → Blame Others
- Use additional evidence to overcome resistance
- Maintain focus on objective performance data

### Moving from Blame Others → Assume Responsibility (THE CRITICAL STEP)
This is an **emotional step**, not intellectual.

**The realization**: "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"

**Implication**: This means work and unpleasantness for the subordinate

**Your role**: Guide them to this emotional breakthrough

### Moving from Assume Responsibility → Find Solution
This is an **intellectual step** and is relatively easier once responsibility is assumed.
- Finding the solution becomes a shared task
- Collaborate on actionable steps

## Step 3: Evaluate Possible Outcomes

| Outcome | Description | Next Steps |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure | Proceed with implementation |
| 2 | Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure | Proceed with implementation |
| 3 | Subordinate disagrees and does not commit | Execute Fallback Procedure |

## Step 4: Execute Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')

When the subordinate refuses to assume responsibility:

### 4.1 Assume Formal Authority
- Take the formal role of supervisor endowed with position power
- Shift from collaborative to directive mode

### 4.2 State Direct Instruction
"This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."

### 4.3 Acknowledge Disagreement
"I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."

### 4.4 Assert Organizational Requirement
"I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."

### 4.5 Secure Commitment
- Obtain explicit commitment to the course of action
- Document the commitment

### 4.6 Monitor Performance
- Track performance against the commitment
- Follow up on specified timeline

## Critical Distinctions

| Aspect | Emotional Step | Intellectual Step |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Stage | Assume Responsibility | Find Solution |
| Difficulty | Hard | Easier |
| Your Role | Guide emotional breakthrough | Collaborate on solutions |

## Prerequisites
- You possess facts and examples demonstrating the performance problem
- Subordinate is at risk of termination unless performance improves
- You are prepared to use position power if necessary

## Constraints
- Process cannot proceed to solution-finding if subordinate is stuck in denial or blame stages
- Must have objective evidence to support each stage transition
