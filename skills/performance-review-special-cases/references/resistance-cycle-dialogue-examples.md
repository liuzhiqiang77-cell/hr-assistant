# Resistance Cycle Dialogue Examples

## Stage 1: Ignore → Stage 2: Deny

**Manager**: "I've noticed that your sales numbers have been below target for the past three months. We need to discuss this."

**Subordinate**: "I'm not sure what you mean. My numbers are fine."

**Manager**: "Let me show you the data. In January you were at 70% of target, February at 65%, and March at 60%. This represents a consistent decline."

**Subordinate**: "Well, I guess the numbers are what they are, but the market has been tough."

## Stage 3: Blame Others → Stage 4: Assume Responsibility

**Manager**: "Even with those challenges, you made 20 calls per week when the target is 40. Your follow-up rate is 50% when the team average is 80%. These are within your control."

**Subordinate**: "But if I had better leads..."

**Manager**: "I hear you about the leads. But let's focus on what you can control. If you increase your call volume to 40 and follow-up to 80%, what would happen to your numbers?"

**Subordinate**: *[Long pause]* "I guess... I guess I'd probably hit my targets."

**Manager**: "What does that tell you?"

**Subordinate**: *[Sighs]* "It means I need to step up my activity. It's on me."

# Fallback Procedure Dialogue

**Manager**: "I understand you feel that the leads are the problem and that you're doing everything you can."

**Subordinate**: "Exactly. It's not my fault I'm missing target."

**Manager**: "I hear you, and you may be right. However, this is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do. I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions."

**Subordinate**: "But I don't agree!"

**Manager**: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right. But this is what I want you to do: Increase your call volume to 40 per week, improve your follow-up rate to 80%, and report to me every Friday on your progress."

**Subordinate**: "This is unfair."

**Manager**: "I hear your frustration. And I need your commitment to follow these instructions. Can you commit to this plan?"

**Subordinate**: "Fine. I'll do it."

**Manager**: "Thank you. I'll be monitoring your progress every week."
