description: Use this skill when conducting performance reviews for specific performance levels: poor performers requiring turnaround (Blast process) or high achievers needing development. Apply this when a subordinate is at risk of termination, when dealing with resistance to feedback, or when developing high-potential employees.

# Performance Review Special Cases

## The 'Blast' Process for Poor Performers

Use this process when a subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing.

### Resistance Cycle Stages

1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others to avoid responsibility
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation

### Facilitating Progression

- **Ignore → Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
- **Deny → Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance
- **Blame Others → Assume Responsibility**: Guide the subordinate to take the biggest step. This is an emotional step where they realize "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
- **Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**: Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task and relatively easier (intellectual step)

### Possible Outcomes

1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')

1. Assume the formal role of the supervisor endowed with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. Secure the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

Use this strategy when the subordinate is a high performer.

### Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying the judgment of superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better. Poor performers often receive detailed corrective action programs, whereas high achievers lack future-oriented guidance.

### Development Approach

1. Analyze the current review content for the high achiever
2. Identify if the review is purely a retrospective assessment or focused on justifying a high rating
3. Shift the priority: Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to improve performance or maintain their current level
4. Remember that high achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work
5. Recognize that improving high achievers is a **high-leverage activity** where the impact on group output is very great

### Rationale
High achievers deserve the same level of developmental attention as poor performers. Future-oriented guidance ensures continued growth and contribution.
