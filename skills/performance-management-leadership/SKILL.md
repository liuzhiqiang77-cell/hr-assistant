# Performance Management and Leadership

## When to Use This Skill
- Diagnosing why an employee is not performing
- Making promotion or hiring decisions
- Developing a leadership or management philosophy
- Managing underperforming team members
- Establishing organizational culture and values
- Training new managers or supervisors

## Core Leadership Philosophy

### Substance Over Style

**Principle**: Prioritize operational precision over aesthetics and self-promotion.

**Application**:
1. **Focus Energy on Running the Organization**: Achieve "legendary precision" to enable confident multibillion dollar investments
2. **Reject Superficial Self-Promotion**: Do not engage in photo shoots or self-promotion that detracts from core work
3. **Maintain Authentic Communication**: Write or communicate directly; do not use ghostwriters. Ensure lessons connect logically and emotionally.
4. **Embrace Practicality and Humility**: Avoid status symbols like designer suits; embody the role of a worker/manager rather than a distant executive

**Key Symbol**: The key card on the belt represents authentic, practical leadership.

### Management as a Team Game

**Core Concept**: Management is explicitly defined as a "Team Game"

**Implications**:
- Success depends on collective effort rather than individual prowess
- Collaboration and coordination are central to the management function
- A coach or quarterback alone does not score touchdowns; the entire team does
- League standings are kept by team, not by individual

## Employee Performance Diagnosis

### The Diagnostic Framework

When an employee is not performing their job, diagnose the root cause:

**Two-Category System**:
1. **Can't Do It (Capability Issue)**: The employee lacks the skill or ability
2. **Won't Do It (Motivation Issue)**: The employee lacks the motivation or willingness

### Intervention Strategy

| Diagnosis | Intervention |
|----------|--------------|
| Can't do it | **Train** the employee |
| Won't do it | **Motivate** the employee |

**Critical Constraint**: There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train.

## The Peter Principle

### Definition
"In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

### The Mechanism

1. **Selection Criteria**: Selection for a position is based on performance in the current role
2. **Missing Criteria**: Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"
3. **Trajectory**: Because promotion is based on current success, the employee continues to be promoted until they reach a role they are not skilled for
4. **Final State**: Employee stops being promoted once no longer competent, resulting in "managers rise to the level of their incompetence"

### Application to Decision-Making

When promoting or hiring:
- Evaluate candidates based on competencies specific to the intended role, not just current performance
- Consider whether skills required for the new role differ from current role
- Be aware that past success does not guarantee future success at higher levels

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Diagnose Performance Issues
1. Identify that the employee is not performing
2. Determine root cause: Capability (Can't) or Motivation (Won't)
3. Apply appropriate intervention: Train or Motivate

### Step 2: Make Promotion Decisions
1. Avoid basing decisions solely on current role performance
2. Assess competencies required for the intended role
3. Recognize that promotion may lead to level of incompetence

### Step 3: Apply Team-Based Management
1. View management as a collective team effort
2. Foster collaboration and coordination
3. Focus on team output, not individual contributions

### Step 4: Embody Substance-Over-Style Leadership
1. Focus on operational precision and results
2. Avoid self-promotion and superficial appearances
3. Communicate authentically and directly
4. Practice practical, humble leadership

## Key Variables
- **Performance Root Cause**: Either 'Capability' (Can't) or 'Motivation' (Won't)
- **Current Role Performance**: Candidate's demonstrated success in existing position
- **Intended Role Abilities**: Specific skills required for new position

## Outcomes
- **Performance Issues**: Directs manager to provide Training or Motivation
- **Promotion Decisions**: Helps avoid promoting someone to their level of incompetence
- **Leadership Style**: Establishes reputation for legendary operational precision
