# The 'Blast' Process - Detailed Stage Guidance

## Stage 1: Ignore

**Behaviors to Watch For**:
- Subordinate doesn't acknowledge the problem exists
- Avoids discussion of performance issues
- Acts as if everything is fine

**Manager Actions**:
- Present concrete facts and examples
- Show data demonstrating the performance gap
- Make the problem visible and undeniable

## Stage 2: Deny

**Behaviors to Watch For**:
- Active rejection that the problem exists
- Claims data is wrong or misinterpreted
- Minimizes the significance of issues

**Manager Actions**:
- Bring additional evidence
- Use multiple sources of feedback
- Get agreement on facts before moving to causes

## Stage 3: Blame Others

**Behaviors to Watch For**:
- Admits problem exists but attributes it to external factors
- Blames other departments, customers, or circumstances
- "It's not my fault" mentality

**Manager Actions**:
- Acknowledge external factors but focus on what's within control
- Ask: "What could you have done differently?"
- Guide toward personal accountability

## Stage 4: Assume Responsibility (THE CRITICAL STEP)

**Why This Is Hard**:
- This is an **emotional step**, not intellectual
- Realizing "It's my problem" implies "I have to do something about it"
- Doing something means work, effort, and potential unpleasantness

**Manager Actions**:
- Create a safe environment for admission
- Don't punish the admission
- Frame responsibility as empowerment: "Now you can fix it"
- Recognize this as the turning point

**Signs of Success**:
- Subordinate says "I need to..." or "I should have..."
- Shift from defensive to constructive language
- Willingness to discuss solutions

## Stage 5: Find Solution

**Why This Is Easier**:
- This is an **intellectual step**
- Once responsibility is assumed, solving becomes a shared task
- Energy shifts from resistance to action

**Manager Actions**:
- Brainstorm solutions together
- Offer support and resources
- Create an action plan with timelines
- Set up follow-up mechanisms

## Emotional vs. Intellectual Distinction

The text emphasizes that:
- **Assuming Responsibility** = Emotional step (hard)
- **Finding Solution** = Intellectual step (easier)

Many managers try to jump to solutions before the emotional work is done, which fails. The subordinate must first accept responsibility before they can genuinely commit to a solution.
