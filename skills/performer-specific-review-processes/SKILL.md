description: Apply specialized review processes for different performer types: the 'Blast' process for poor performers requiring turnaround, and the High Achiever Development Strategy for top performers. Use when conducting reviews for employees at either extreme of the performance spectrum.

# Performer-Specific Review Processes

## When to Use
- A subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing
- A subordinate is a high achiever who could perform even better
- You need to move beyond standard review processes for extreme performers

## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process (For Poor Performers)

### Prerequisites
- Manager possesses facts and examples
- Subordinate is at risk of termination unless performance improves

### Step 1: Identify the Current Stage
Track which stage the subordinate is in:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. Ignore | Passive ignoring of the problem |
| 2. Deny | Active denial of the problem's existence |
| 3. Blame Others | Admits problem exists but blames others |
| 4. Assume Responsibility | Admits "It is my problem" |
| 5. Find Solution | Intellectual step to remedy the situation |

### Step 2: Facilitate Progression

**Moving from Ignore to Deny:**
- Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality

**Moving from Deny to Blame Others:**
- Use evidence to overcome resistance

**Moving from Blame Others to Assume Responsibility:**
- Guide the subordinate to take the "biggest step"
- This is an **emotional step** where they realize "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
- This implies work and unpleasantness

**Moving from Assume Responsibility to Find Solution:**
- Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task
- This is an **intellectual step** (easier than the emotional step)

### Step 3: Evaluate Possible Outcomes
1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Step 4: Execute Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at "Blame Others")
1. Assume the formal role of supervisor with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. Secure the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### Prerequisites
- Performance review process initiated
- Subordinate identified as high performer

### Step 1: Analyze Current Review Content
Identify if the review is:
- Purely a "retrospective assessment" (analyzing past performance)
- Focused on justifying a high rating

### Step 2: Recognize the Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better.

### Step 3: Contrast with Poor Performers
Poor performers often receive detailed "corrective action programs" (step-by-step affairs to meet minimum requirements), whereas high achievers often lack future-oriented guidance.

### Step 4: Shift the Priority
Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to:
- Improve performance further
- Maintain their current high level

### Step 5: Remember the Leverage Principle
High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a "high-leverage activity" where the impact on group output is very great.

## Key Distinctions
- **Assuming Responsibility** is an emotional step (hard)
- **Finding Solution** is an intellectual step (easier)
- High achievers need future-oriented guidance, not just past justification
- Poor performers need a structured path through resistance stages
