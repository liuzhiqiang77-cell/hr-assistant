# Employee Assessment Diagnostics

## When to Use
- Employee reacts unexpectedly to raise or compensation change
- Need to assess subordinate performance
- Determining what need level is driving motivation
- Evaluating whether motivation is deficit-based or growth-based
- Conducting performance reviews

## Diagnostic Tools

### Money Motivation Hierarchy Test
Use this test to determine which need level is driving an employee's motivation based on their reaction to compensation.

**Procedure**:
1. Observe employee's reaction to salary increase or compensation change
2. Identify focus of reaction:
   - **Scenario A**: Focus on ABSOLUTE SUM of money received
   - **Scenario B**: Focus on RELATIVE COMPARISON against others
3. Determine motivation mode

**Interpretation**:
- **Scenario A (Absolute Sum)**: Physiological or Safety needs
  - Money is utilitarian resource
  - Motivation ceases when target is met
  - Deficit need
  
- **Scenario B (Relative Comparison)**: Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization
  - Money is measure of achievement
  - Motivation is boundless
  - Growth need

### Black Box Assessment Methodology
Use this framework to evaluate subordinate performance using both tangible output and internal contributions.

**Procedure**:
1. **Define Expectations**
   - Clarify expected standards in advance
   - Ensure assessment against clear criteria

2. **Evaluate Output Measures** (Output of Black Box)
   - Tangible results
   - Items that can be plotted on charts
   - Examples: Completed designs, sales quotas, production yield

3. **Evaluate Internal Measures** (Inside Black Box)
   - Activities creating current output
   - Activities setting stage for future output
   - Examples: Positioning/developing people, ensuring department health

4. **Determine Weighting**
   - No strict formula
   - Situational (50/50, 90/10, 10/90)
   - Can shift monthly

5. **Trade-off Analysis**
   - Explicitly identify variables being traded off
   - Document rationale for final assessment

## Result Interpretation

### Money Motivation Test Results
- **Lower Levels (Physiological/Safety)**: Money satisfies deficit need
  - Utilitarian view of compensation
  - Motivation has ceiling
  
- **Upper Levels (Esteem/Self-Actualization)**: Money satisfies growth need
  - Scorecard view of compensation
  - Motivation is boundless
  - "Second ten million" as important as first

### Black Box Assessment Results
- **High Output, Low Internal**: Good short-term, may have long-term issues
- **Low Output, High Internal**: Building for future, current performance concern
- **High Output, High Internal**: Ideal, sustainable performance
- **Low Output, Low Internal**: Performance problem, intervention needed
