# Example Scenario: Intel Sales Manager

## Context
An Intel sales manager uses trend indicators to convince their supervisor of a business slowdown.

## Process
1. **Data Review**: Sales manager presents trend indicators showing declining orders
2. **Joint Analysis**: Supervisor and manager review data together, considering seasonal factors
3. **Conclusion**: Both agree this is a genuine slowdown, not seasonal variation
4. **Decision**: Adopt conservative approach to near-term investment
5. **Cascade**: Supervisor shares this conclusion with other business groups

## Result
- Expansion plans scaled back across multiple groups
- Resources allocated more conservatively
- Single meeting leveraged across entire organization

## Leverage Calculation
- **Input**: 1.5 hours of meeting time
- **Output**: 80+ hours of aligned work quality over two weeks
- **Multiplier**: Decision cascades to multiple business units
