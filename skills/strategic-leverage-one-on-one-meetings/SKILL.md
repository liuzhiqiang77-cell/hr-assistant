# Strategic Leverage of One-on-One Meetings

Use this skill when you have scheduled recurring one-on-one meetings with subordinates and want to maximize their strategic impact.

## When to Use

- You are a supervisor scheduling regular 1-on-1 meetings with direct reports
- You need to establish a shared information base with a subordinate
- You want to enable more effective delegation
- You need to analyze business data and trends together with your subordinate
- You want to cascade strategic alignment across multiple business units

## Execution Steps

1. **Calculate Leverage Potential**
   - Recognize that a small time investment (1.5 hours) can enhance work quality for a significant duration (two weeks or 80+ hours)
   - Upgrade your understanding of the subordinate's tasks and context

2. **Establish Common Base**
   - Use the meeting to develop a shared understanding of information and methods
   - Create "similar ways of doing and handling things" between supervisor and subordinate

3. **Enable Delegation**
   - Acknowledge that this shared base is the foundation for efficient and effective delegation

4. **Facilitate Reverse Teaching**
   - Allow the subordinate to teach you specific details and data
   - This information is essential for making good decisions

5. **Joint Data Analysis**
   - Review specific indicators together (e.g., trend indicators of incoming orders)
   - Ponder the data and consider relationships to other industry indicators
   - Distinguish between temporary anomalies (e.g., seasonal slowness) and actual business trends (e.g., business stopped growing)

6. **Formulate Congruent Conclusions**
   - Develop a shared attitude, approach, and conclusion based on the analysis
   - Example: Decide to take a "conservative approach to near-term investment" rather than assuming growth

7. **Execute Cascading Actions**
   - **Subordinate**: Implements decisions in their area of responsibility
   - **Supervisor**: Shares conclusions with other business groups or managers, multiplying the leverage

## Variables

- `meeting_duration`: Length of the one-on-one session (e.g., 1.5 hours)
- `impact_duration`: Period of enhanced work quality (e.g., two weeks)
- `information_base`: Shared understanding and context between supervisor and subordinate

## Prerequisites

- Regular scheduled meeting time (e.g., every two weeks)
- Hierarchical reporting relationship
- Willingness to share information openly
- Time investment from supervisor

## Constraints

- Requires willingness to share information openly
- Requires time investment from supervisor
