# Employee Retention and Relationships

## When to Use This Skill

- A subordinate expresses interest in friendship outside professional boundaries
- You're considering socializing with a direct report
- A valued subordinate announces resignation due to feeling unappreciated
- An employee you want to retain is considering leaving

## Manager-Friendship Compatibility Test

### The Visualization Test

When deciding whether to establish a friendship with a subordinate, perform this simple assessment:

1. **Imagine:** Visualize yourself delivering a tough performance review to the person you are considering befriending

2. **Assess Your Physical/Emotional Reaction:**
   - **Scenario A:** You cringe at the thought
   - **Scenario B:** Your stomach remains unaffected

3. **Apply Decision Rule:**
   - **IF Scenario A (Cringe):** Do not make friends at work. The relationship will likely hinder your professional duties.
   - **IF Scenario B (Unaffected):** Proceed with friendship. Personal relationships will likely strengthen work relationships.

**Conclusion:** Everyone must decide for themselves what is professional and appropriate based on this subjective assessment of your personal emotional reaction.

## Retaining a Valued Subordinate Who Resigns

### Prerequisites

This procedure applies when:
- The subordinate is highly valued, dedicated, and loyal
- The subordinate feels work is unappreciated
- The resignation is **not** solely motivated by money or perks at another company

**Does NOT apply if:**
- The employee is purely motivated by better financial offers elsewhere
- The employee is not considered "valued" or "dedicated"

### Step-by-Step Retention Process

#### Phase 1: The Opening Skirmish (Immediate Reaction)

**Actions:**
1. Drop what you are doing immediately
2. Sit the subordinate down and ask why they are quitting
3. Let them talk completely—do not argue, lecture, or panic
4. Allow them to deliver rehearsed points, then ask more questions to uncover real issues
5. Convey through actions that they are important to you

**Goal:** Buy time to prepare for the next round. Do not try to change their mind yet.

#### Phase 2: Supervisor Involvement

**Actions:**
1. Go to your supervisor for help and advice
2. Make the resignation your supervisor's problem

**Rationale:** Ensures they participate in the solution and provides organizational backing.

#### Phase 3: Corporate Citizenship & Solution Pursuit

**Actions:**
1. Vigorously pursue every avenue to keep the employee with the firm
2. Be willing to transfer them to another department if necessary
3. Become the project manager of the solution until settled

**Principle:** You owe it to the employer to save an employee for the company (Golden Rule: reciprocity among managers).

#### Phase 4: Presenting the Solution

**Actions:**
1. Return with a solution that addresses real reasons and benefits the company
2. Reframe the situation to alleviate fears of being viewed as a "blackmailer"

**Key Script:**
> "You did not blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways."

#### Phase 5: Countering External Offers

**If the subordinate has accepted another job:**

**Make them "quit again"**—renounce the other offer.

**Argument:**
- They have made two commitments:
  1. One to a vague potential employer
  2. One to you and their current team

- Emphasize that commitments to daily colleagues are far stronger than those to a "casual new acquaintance"

## Interaction Style

**Empathetic but Strategic:**
- Listen deeply and validate feelings
- Act decisively and systematically
- Balance emotional support with business solutions
