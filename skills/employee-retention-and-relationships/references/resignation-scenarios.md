# Resignation Scenarios

## Scenario: When This Procedure Works Best

**Situation:** Maria, your top-performing engineer of 5 years, hands in her resignation.

**During the opening conversation:**
- Maria explains she's been passed over for promotion twice
- She feels her contributions aren't recognized
- She has an offer from a competitor with only a 5% salary increase

**Why this applies:**
- She is highly valued and dedicated (5 years of strong performance)
- Primary motivation is feeling unappreciated, not money (5% increase is negligible)
- She has emotional investment in the team

## Scenario: When This Procedure Does NOT Apply

**Situation:** John, a mid-level salesperson, announces he's leaving.

**During the opening conversation:**
- He's been with the company 8 months
- Another company offered 40% more salary
- He has equity vesting soon that he'll lose
- Performance has been average

**Why this does NOT apply:**
- Primary motivation is financial (40% increase)
- Not considered "valued" in the sense of being irreplaceable
- Short tenure (8 months)

**Appropriate action:** Accept the resignation, wish him well, and focus on replacement planning.
