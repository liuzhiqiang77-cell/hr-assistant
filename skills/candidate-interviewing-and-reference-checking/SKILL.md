# Candidate Interviewing and Reference Checking

## When to Use This Skill
- Conducting an interview session with a job candidate
- Planning interview strategy and approach
- Checking references after initial interviews
- Conducting follow-up interviews
- Making final hiring decisions

## Core Principles

### Maintain Honesty
- Do not use tricks or gimmicks to test character
- Show yourself and the environment as they really are
- Remember: wrong first impressions take time to change if hired

### Ultimate Purpose
- Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance
- Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit
- Recognize that careful interviewing increases odds but does not guarantee success

## Interview Execution

### 1. Categorize Your Inquiries
Ensure comprehensive coverage across these areas:
- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, technical capabilities, weaknesses
- **What They Did With Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures
- **Discrepancies**: Learning from failures, problems in current position
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new job, why the company should hire them

### 2. Use Direct Questions
- Ask blunt questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?")
- Observe the candidate's reaction and confidence level
- Gauge actual capability through response quality and demeanor

### 3. Employ Hypothetical Situations
- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job
- Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result
- Assess problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly

### 4. Invite Candidate Questions
- Ask what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job
- Analyze their questions to determine:
  - What they already know
  - What they value
  - How prepared they are

## Reference Checking Protocol

### Goal
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.

### Build Rapport
- If you know the reference personally, leverage that relationship for candid information
- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

### Timing Strategy
- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes
- Invest time in building the relationship before seeking critical information

## Follow-Up Process

### Conduct Follow-Up Interviews
- If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from reference checks
- Resolve any discrepancies or concerns

### Acknowledge Limitations
- Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- Accept that it merely increases the odds of hiring well
- Factor this uncertainty into your final decision

## Assessment Output
Generate an evaluation covering:
- Candidate's technical skills and capabilities
- Problem-solving capacity and reasoning ability
- Operational values and cultural fit
- Potential contribution in your environment
- Risk factors and limitations
