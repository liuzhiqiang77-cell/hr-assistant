# Performance Review Processes by Performance Level

## When to Use
- Conducting a review for a poor performer at risk of termination
- Conducting a review for a high achiever who could improve further
- Managing performance turnaround or development conversations

## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process (Poor Performers)

Use when a subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing.

### Identify the Resistance Cycle Stage

1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others to avoid responsibility
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation

### Facilitate Progression Through Stages

1. **Ignore → Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
2. **Deny → Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance
3. **Blame Others → Assume Responsibility**: Guide the subordinate to take the "biggest step"
   - This is an emotional step where the subordinate realizes "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
4. **Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**: Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task and relatively easier

### Possible Outcomes

1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')

1. Assume the formal role of the supervisor endowed with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. Secure the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

Use when the subordinate is a high performer.

### Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying the judgment of superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better.

### Development Approach

1. **Analyze the current review content** for the high achiever
2. **Identify if the review is purely retrospective** (analyzing past performance) or focused on justifying a high rating
3. **Contrast with poor performers**: Poor performers often receive detailed "corrective action programs," whereas high achievers often lack future-oriented guidance
4. **Shift the priority**: Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to improve performance or maintain their current level
5. **Rationale**: High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a "high-leverage activity" where the impact on group output is very great.

## Key Variables
- `current_stage`: The current stage of the subordinate (Ignore, Deny, Blame Others, Assume Responsibility, Find Solution)
- `evidence_available`: Whether the manager has sufficient facts and examples to demonstrate reality
- `subordinate_performance_level`: Classification of the employee (High Achiever, Poor Performer)
- `review_focus`: Whether the review is retrospective (past) or developmental (future)
