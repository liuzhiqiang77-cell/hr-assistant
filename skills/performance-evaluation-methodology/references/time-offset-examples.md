# Time Offset Evaluation Examples

## Example 1: R&D Project Lead

**Situation**: Scientist spent entire year on research with no publications or products.

**Mistake**: Rate poorly due to lack of output.

**Correct Evaluation**:
- Activities: Conducted 50 experiments, documented findings, built knowledge base
- Time Offset: Results will appear in 2-3 years
- Present Value: If research leads to 3 patents worth $5M each, credit $15M present value
- Rating: High performance based on strong activities and high future value

## Example 2: Manufacturing Plant Setup

**Situation**: Manager spent year setting up new facility with no production output.

**Mistake**: Rate as "below expectations" due to zero production.

**Correct Evaluation**:
- Activities: Secured site, hired staff, installed equipment, established processes
- Time Offset: Production will begin next quarter
- Present Value: Facility will produce $50M annually over 10 years
- Rating: Exceeds expectations based on successful setup and high future value

## Example 3: Software Architecture Redesign

**Situation**: Architect spent 6 months redesigning system with no features shipped.

**Mistake**: Rate poorly due to lack of feature delivery.

**Correct Evaluation**:
- Activities: Completed architecture redesign, documented patterns, trained team
- Time Offset: Benefits will accrue over next 2 years
- Present Value: Redesign reduces maintenance costs by 30% ($2M/year)
- Rating: High performance based on long-term value creation

## Potential Trap Examples

## Example 1: Sales Manager

**Situation**: Sales team missed quota by 40%, but manager worked 80-hour weeks, attended all meetings, and "looked the part."

**Mistake**: Rate manager as "exceeds expectations" due to effort and appearance.

**Correct Application**:
- Organization Rating: "Below Expectations" (missed quota by 40%)
- Maximum Manager Rating: "Below Expectations"
- Rationale: Substance (results) over form (effort/appearance)

## Example 2: Engineering Manager

**Situation**: Engineering team delivered product 6 months late with quality issues, but manager has MBA, great presentation skills, and "leadership presence."

**Mistake**: Rate manager as "meets expectations" due to "potential."

**Correct Application**:
- Organization Rating: "Poor" (late delivery, quality issues)
- Maximum Manager Rating: "Poor"
- Rationale: Results matter, not credentials or presence
