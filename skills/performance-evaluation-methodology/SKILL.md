description: Evaluate performance accounting for time offsets between activities and results, and enforce the potential trap rule ensuring manager ratings cannot exceed organization ratings. Use when assessing performance where results lag behind efforts or when rating managers whose organizations underperformed.

# Performance Evaluation Methodology

## When to Use
- Reviewing performance where tangible output is not immediately visible
- Evaluating work with long-term impact (e.g., infrastructure, R&D)
- Rating managers whose organizations have poor performance
- Assessing performance where results lag behind activities

## Time Offset and Long-Term Assessment

### Step 1: Analyze Time Offset

Determine if output in the review period is linked to activities in the same period.

**Key Concept**: Current output may be the "light from distant stars"—reflecting work done months or years ago.

### Step 2: Judge Performance Based on Activities

| Situation | Evaluation Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Tangible output absent, but activities strong | Give credit for performance-building activities |
| Building future capacity (e.g., setting up facility) | Do not penalize for lack of immediate output |
| Immediate outputs visible | Evaluate against standard metrics |

### Step 3: Weigh Long-Term vs. Short-Term

**Short-Term Outputs**:
- Meeting schedules
- Hitting quarterly targets
- Delivering immediate results

**Long-Term Activities**:
- Improving design methods
- Building infrastructure
- Developing systems and processes

### Step 4: Apply "Present Value" Concept

Estimate the current worth of future-oriented activities:
1. Calculate expected future payback over time
2. Determine what that future value is worth today
3. Include this "present value" in the current performance assessment

**Example**: An employee spending 6 months improving a manufacturing process may show no immediate output, but if the improvement saves $1M over 3 years, calculate and credit that present value in the current review.

## The Potential Trap Rule

### Step 1: Assess Substance Over Form

**Evaluate**:
- Actual performance and real output
- Tangible results delivered

**Ignore**:
- "Potential" defined as form (knowledge, appearance, "looking like a manager")
- Charisma or presentation skills without results

### Step 2: Apply the Organization Cap

**RULE**: The performance rating of a manager **cannot be higher** than the rating accorded to their organization.

| Organization Performance | Maximum Manager Rating |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Lost money | Cannot exceed "Poor" |
| Missed revenue forecasts | Cannot exceed "Below Expectations" |
| Slipped schedules | Cannot exceed "Meets Requirements" |
| Poor internal measures | Cannot exceed "Meets Requirements" |

### Step 3: Enforce Consequences

If the business unit:
- Lost money
- Missed revenue forecasts
- Slipped schedules
- Showed poor internal measures

**Then**: The manager **cannot receive a high rating**, regardless of personal traits or effort.

### Step 4: Prevent Negative Signaling

**Reject**: Excuses that "the organization failed but the manager is outstanding."

**Reinforce**: Performing like a manager is the requirement, not acting like one.

**Risk**: Allowing high ratings for managers of failing organizations signals that "acting" like a manager is sufficient.
