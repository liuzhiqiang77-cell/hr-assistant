# Performance Review Interventions

## When to Use This Skill
- An employee has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing
- Conducting a review for a high achiever who needs development guidance
- An employee is at risk of termination unless performance improves
- You want to maximize the impact of your top performers

## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process

### When to Use
- Subordinate has a major performance problem
- Turnaround is required to avoid firing
- Employee is in denial or blaming others

### The Resistance Cycle

| Stage | Behavior | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Ignore | Passive ignoring of the problem |
| 2 | Deny | Active denial of the problem's existence |
| 3 | Blame Others | Admits problem exists but blames others |
| 4 | Assume Responsibility | Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step) |
| 5 | Find Solution | Intellectual step to remedy the situation |

### Step 1: Identify Current Stage
Determine where the subordinate is in the resistance cycle.

### Step 2: Facilitate Progression

**From Ignore to Deny**:
- Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality

**From Deny to Blame Others**:
- Use evidence to overcome resistance

**From Blame Others to Assume Responsibility**:
- Guide the subordinate to take the "biggest step"
- This is an **emotional step** where they realize "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
- Acknowledge this implies work and unpleasantness

**From Assume Responsibility to Find Solution**:
- Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task
- This is an **intellectual step** and is relatively easier

### Step 3: Evaluate Possible Outcomes

| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure |
| 2 | Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure |
| 3 | Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit |

### Step 4: Execute Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')

1. Assume the formal role of supervisor endowed with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. Secure the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### When to Use
- Subordinate is a high performer
- Review is focused on justifying a high rating
- You want to leverage high achievers for maximum organizational impact

### Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying the judgment of superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better.

### Contrast with Poor Performers
- Poor performers receive detailed "corrective action programs" (step-by-step affairs to meet minimum requirements)
- High achievers often lack future-oriented guidance

### Step 1: Analyze Current Review Content
Determine if the review is:
- Purely a retrospective assessment (analyzing past performance)
- Focused on justifying a high rating

### Step 2: Shift Priority
Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to:
- Improve performance
- Maintain current level
- Prepare for next-level responsibilities

### Step 3: Apply Leverage Principle
**High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work.** Improving them is a "high-leverage activity" where the impact on group output is very great.

### Step 4: Create Development Plan
Include specific steps for future improvement, not just past justification.

## Constraints
- The 'Blast' process cannot proceed to solution-finding if subordinate is stuck in denial or blame stages
- High achiever strategy does not apply to poor performers who require corrective action programs
