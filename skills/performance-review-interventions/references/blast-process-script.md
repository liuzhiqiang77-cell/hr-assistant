# 'Blast' Process Conversation Script

## Stage 1: Moving from Ignore to Deny

**Manager**: "I need to discuss your performance over the last quarter. Let me share some specific examples."

**Manager**: "On Project X, the deadline was missed by two weeks. On Project Y, the client reported three quality issues. On Project Z, you didn't attend three of the five scheduled team meetings."

**Manager**: "These are facts from our records. Can you see why I'm concerned?"

## Stage 2: Moving from Deny to Blame Others

**Subordinate**: "Those deadlines weren't realistic. The client is being unreasonable about quality. The meetings weren't important."

**Manager**: "I understand your perspective. Let me show you the data. Other team members met the same deadlines on similar projects. The client's quality standards are documented in our contract. The meetings were where critical decisions were made that affected your work."

**Manager**: "The pattern is clear across multiple projects and situations. This isn't about one client or one deadline."

## Stage 3: Moving from Blame Others to Responsibility

**Subordinate**: "Well, if marketing had provided better leads, and if engineering had been more responsive..."

**Manager**: "I hear that you're frustrated with other departments. But let's focus on what you can control."

**Manager**: "In the situations where you had full control—your time management, your communication with the client, your attendance at meetings—what could you have done differently?"

**Manager**: "This is the hard question: What part of this is yours to own?"

## Stage 4: Assuming Responsibility (The Emotional Step)

**Subordinate**: "I guess... I didn't prioritize well. I avoided the client calls because I didn't want to deal with their complaints. I didn't prepare for the meetings."

**Manager**: "Thank you for being honest. That's not easy to admit."

**Manager**: "Now we're at the real question: If this is your problem, what are you going to do about it?"

## Stage 5: Finding Solutions

**Manager**: "Let's work together on a plan. What specific actions will you take this week?"

**Subordinate**: "I'll call the client tomorrow. I'll block time for meeting prep. I'll use a task management system."

**Manager**: "Good. Let's write those down and set up weekly check-ins."

## Fallback: Position Power

**Subordinate**: "I still think the deadlines were unfair and the client is unreasonable. I'm not going to change my approach."

**Manager**: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."

**Manager**: "However, I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions."

**Manager**: "This is what I want you to do: [Specific instructions]."

**Manager**: "I need your commitment that you will follow these instructions."

**Manager**: "We will review your progress against these instructions in two weeks."
