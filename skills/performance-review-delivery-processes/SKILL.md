# Performance Review Delivery Processes

## When to Use This Skill
- Conducting performance reviews with subordinates
- Handling major performance problems requiring turnaround
- Developing high achievers
- Ensuring review integrity and proper delivery protocols

## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process

**Use when**: A subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing.

### Step 1: Identify the Resistance Stage
Track the subordinate's current stage:

| Stage | Behavior | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Ignore | Passive ignoring | Pretends problem doesn't exist |
| 2. Deny | Active denial | Admits nothing is wrong |
| 3. Blame Others | Deflection | Admits problem exists but blames others |
| 4. Assume Responsibility | Acceptance | Admits "It is my problem" |
| 5. Find Solution | Problem-solving | Works on remedy |

### Step 2: Facilitate Progression
- **Ignore → Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
- **Deny → Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance
- **Blame Others → Assume Responsibility**: Guide to take the "biggest step" (emotional step)
- **Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**: Shared task, intellectual step (easier)

**Critical Insight**: "Assuming Responsibility" is an emotional step (hard), while "Finding Solution" is an intellectual step (easier).

### Step 3: Evaluate Outcomes
- **Outcome 1**: Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
- **Outcome 2**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
- **Outcome 3**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Step 4: Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')
1. Assume formal supervisor role with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. Secure commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

**Use when**: Subordinate is a high performer.

### Step 1: Analyze Current Review Content
Determine if the review is:
- Purely retrospective (analyzing past performance)
- Focused on justifying a high rating
- Developmental (focused on future improvement)

### Step 2: Recognize the Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better.

### Step 3: Contrast with Poor Performers
- Poor performers receive detailed "corrective action programs"
- High achievers often lack future-oriented guidance

### Step 4: Shift Priority
Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to:
- Improve performance further
- Maintain current level
- Prepare for next level of responsibility

### Step 5: Apply Leverage Principle
Improving high achievers is a "high-leverage activity" where impact on group output is very great.

## Review Integrity and Delivery Protocols

### Handling Self-Reviews
- **Do NOT** ask for a self-review if you intend to simply change the format and hand it back
- If you rely on the subordinate to tell you their accomplishments, you appear unaware and they feel cheated
- **Preserve integrity**: Make an upfront assessment without being prompted by the subordinate

### Handling Upward Feedback
- You may ask the subordinate to evaluate your performance
- **Clearly state**: Their assessment has only "advisory status"
- **Never pretend** you and subordinates are equals; you are the leader

### Timing of Written Review Delivery

| Option | Timing | Risk |
|--------|--------|------|
| A | During discussion | Subordinate reads ahead, can't discuss paragraph 3, walks away feeling they "should have said" something |
| B | After discussion | Subordinate may find a phrase they didn't "hear" and react negatively |
| **Recommended** | Before discussion (with time to process) | Ensures a "good meeting of minds" |

### Enforcing Quality
- If a review is superficial, lacks analysis, or lacks depth, **insist on a rewrite**
- The integrity of the performance review system is more important than the subordinate's preference

## Constraints
- 'Blast' process cannot proceed to solution-finding if subordinate is stuck in denial or blame stages
- Supervisors must not abdicate judgment to subordinates
- High achiever strategy does not apply to poor performers requiring corrective action
