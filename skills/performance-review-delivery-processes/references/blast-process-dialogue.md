# 'Blast' Process Dialogue Examples

## Example 1: Moving Through Stages

**Manager**: "John, I need to discuss your performance on the Alpha project. We missed the deadline by 3 weeks, and the client has threatened to cancel."

**John (Stage 1 - Ignore)**: "It's not that bad. The client always threatens. They'll come around."

**Manager**: "Let me show you the email from yesterday. They've put us on notice. Here are the specific dates we committed to and missed." [Shows facts]

**John (Stage 2 - Deny)**: "Well, the requirements changed halfway through. We couldn't have met the original deadline."

**Manager**: "The requirements changed on March 15th. We had already missed the February 28th deadline by then. Here's the project timeline." [Shows evidence]

**John (Stage 3 - Blame Others)**: "Marketing didn't give us clear specs. Engineering was slow on the API. I was waiting on them."

**Manager**: "I understand you faced challenges. But as project lead, it's your responsibility to escalate when you're blocked. You never raised a flag. Let me ask you: What could you have done differently?"

**John (Stage 4 - Assume Responsibility)**: "I should have escalated earlier. I should have pushed back on Marketing. I should have found a way to work around Engineering's delays. It's my problem."

**Manager**: "Exactly. Now that we agree on that, let's work on a solution. What steps will you take to ensure this doesn't happen again?"

**John (Stage 5 - Find Solution)**: "I'll implement weekly status reports. I'll set up a formal escalation process. I'll meet with Marketing to clarify their process."

## Example 2: Fallback Procedure

**Manager**: "Sarah, your team's customer satisfaction scores have dropped 20% this quarter. You need to turn this around."

**Sarah (Stage 3 - Blame Others)**: "It's the new product. It has bugs. Customers are frustrated. I can't help that Engineering released it too early."

**Manager**: "I understand the product has issues. But other teams are managing similar challenges better. Let me show you their scores and their approach." [Shows comparison]

**Sarah**: "Well, they have different customers. Their customers are more understanding. It's not fair to compare."

**Manager**: "Sarah, I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right. But I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."

**Sarah**: "What do you want me to do?"

**Manager**: "1. Implement daily customer issue tracking. 2. Meet with Engineering weekly to prioritize fixes. 3. Personally call the top 10 complaining customers this week. Can you commit to this?"

**Sarah**: "I don't agree with the approach, but I'll do it."

**Manager**: "Thank you. I'll monitor your progress on these items. Let's meet next Friday to review."

## High Achiever Development Example

**Manager**: "Maria, your performance this year has been outstanding. You exceeded your sales target by 40% and mentored two new hires."

**Maria**: "Thank you. I worked hard."

**Manager**: "I want to make sure we're not just celebrating past success. Let's talk about next year. What's the next level for you?"

**Maria**: "I'm not sure. Keep doing what I'm doing?"

**Manager**: "You're already at the top of your current role. To grow, you could: 1) Take on a larger territory, 2) Lead a strategic initiative for the team, or 3) Start preparing for a management role. Which interests you?"

**Maria**: "The strategic initiative sounds interesting. What did you have in mind?"

**Manager**: "We need to revamp our sales process for enterprise accounts. I'd like you to lead that project. It means working with Product, Marketing, and Customer Success. It's a 6-month project. Are you up for it?"

**Maria**: "Yes, that would be a great challenge."

**Manager**: "Excellent. Let's define the objectives and success metrics for this project. This will be a key part of your development plan for next year."
