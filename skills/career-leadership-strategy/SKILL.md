# Career and Leadership Strategy

## When to Use This Skill
- Managing your career in a competitive global environment
- Developing leadership capabilities and personal brand
- Navigating organizational politics and advancement
- Preparing for potential career transitions

## The Sole Proprietor Mindset

### Core Philosophy
- You are not an employee; you are a business with one employee: yourself
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- Fellow workers are not primary rivals—competitors in other organizations outnumber them 1000:1 or more
- Nobody owes you a career; you own it as a sole proprietor

### Daily Actions
- Continually retain your individual competitive advantage
- Enhance your value every day
- Hone your competitive advantage
- Learn and adapt constantly
- Be willing to move from job to job or industry to industry
- Retrench if necessary to start again

## The Three Self-Assessment Questions

### Question 1: Value Addition
**Ask:** "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"

**Action:** Continually look for ways to make things truly better in your department.

**Standard:** Every hour should be spent increasing the output or value of the output of people you're responsible for.

### Question 2: Connectivity
**Ask:** "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"

**Check:** Do not wait for a supervisor to interpret events.

**Status:** Be a node connected to a network of plugged-in people, not floating by yourself.

### Question 3: Innovation
**Ask:** "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"

**Action:** Personally try new things; do not just read about them.

**Warning:** Do not wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of it.

## Substance Over Style Leadership

### Operational Precision
- Focus on running the organization with legendary precision
- This enables high-confidence decision-making on major investments
- Avoid wasting time on appearance if it detracts from core work

### Authentic Communication
- Do not use ghostwriters; communicate directly
- Articulate lessons so they connect logically and emotionally
- Ensure audience understands and feels what you mean

### Practicality and Humility
- Avoid status symbols (designer suits, power poses)
- Embody the role of a worker/manager, not a distant executive

## Managing Internal Threats

### In Slow/No-Growth Environments
- Identify ambitious junior employees blocked by your position
- Anticipate the boss's dilemma: retain you vs. promote the junior
- Take responsibility: move up or move on—don't be "in the way"

## Productivity Principles
- Apply methods of production to your work
- Exercise managerial leverage
- Elicit an athlete's desire for peak performance
