# Career Management in the Global Information Age

## Context: Post-1980s Globalization

### The Information Revolution Impact
- Capital and work can go anywhere on earth
- Domestic markets can be supplied from anywhere
- Geographic and national boundaries are diminishing
- Competition is global, not local

### The Sole Proprietor Reality
- Ratios of competition: 1000:1, 100,000:1, or 1,000,000:1
- Your primary competitors are not in your building
- Job security is largely non-existent
- Continuous adaptation is required for survival

## Internal Threat Assessment

### The Boss's Dilemma
When growth is slow or non-existent:
- Ambitious junior employees want upward movement
- Your position may be blocking their path
- Boss must choose between retaining you (good performance) or promoting the junior (future potential)

### Self-Protection Strategies
- **Move Up**: Seek promotion to create space for others
- **Move On**: Transition to a new role or organization
- **Add Value**: Demonstrate unique, irreplaceable contributions
- **Develop Others**: Show you're not blocking talent development

## Substance Over Style: The Key Card Symbol

### Origin Story
Andy Grove appeared on the book cover "dressed for work right down to his key card hanging from his belt" and did not remove it for the photo.

### What It Represents
- Focus on the work, not the appearance
- Operational precision over personal branding
- Authenticity over self-promotion
- The manager as a worker, not a celebrity

### Contrast with Common Executive Behavior
- Pretty photo shoots
- Designer suits and status symbols
- Arms-folded power poses
- Ghostwritten communications
