# Self-Actualization Driver Types

## Competence-Driven

**Focus**: Job or task mastery

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- Sharpening own skills continuously
- Trying to do better than previous attempts
- Practicing deliberately
- Seeking feedback to improve technique

**Examples**:
- Violinist practicing scales daily for years
- Teenager perfecting a skateboard trick
- Programmer refactoring code for elegance
- Craftsman obsessing over details

**Management Approach**:
- Provide opportunities for skill development
- Give challenging assignments that require mastery
- Offer technical mentorship
- Recognize incremental improvements

## Achievement-Driven

**Focus**: Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- Testing limits of capability
- Working at the "boundary of capability"
- Seeking new challenges across domains
- Measuring success against external standards

**The Peg/Ring Experiment Classification**:

| Type | Risk Profile | Outcome Control | Motivation |
|------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Gambler | High | None | Thrill of risk |
| Conservative | Very Low | High | Safety |
| Achiever | Moderate | Partial | Testing limits |

**Achievers**: Challenge themselves at the boundary of capability to test limits.

**Examples**:
- Entrepreneur starting multiple ventures
- Salesperson pursuing top producer status
- Athlete competing at Olympic level
- Executive seeking to turn around failing companies

**Management Approach**:
- Set ambitious, measurable goals
- Create competitive environments
- Provide recognition for achievements
- Offer progression to higher challenges

## Commonality

Both types **spontaneously try to test the outer limits of their abilities**.

**If drive is not spontaneous**:
- Use MBO with 50-50 success probability goals
- Create competitive benchmarks
- Emphasize output and results
- Normalize failure as part of growth

**Key Insight**: Self-actualization is the ONLY motivation source that does not extinguish after fulfillment. It drives performance to ever-higher levels.
