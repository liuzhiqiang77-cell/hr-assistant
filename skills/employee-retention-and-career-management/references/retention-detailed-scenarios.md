# Detailed Retention Scenarios

## Scenario: External Offer Present

When the subordinate has already accepted another position:

1. **Make them "quit again"**: The employee must actively renounce the external offer
2. **Two commitments argument**:
   - Commitment 1: To a vague potential employer (new company)
   - Commitment 2: To you and their current team (daily colleagues)
3. **Emotional leverage**: Daily working relationships create stronger bonds than new, untested relationships
4. **Timing**: Act quickly before the external offer becomes psychologically binding

## Scenario: Purely Financial Motivation

**Do NOT apply this procedure if**:
- The resignation is solely motivated by money or perks at another company
- The employee is not considered "valued" or "dedicated"
- The employee has a history of job-hopping for compensation

In these cases, the retention procedure is unlikely to succeed and may set unrealistic expectations for other employees.

## Reframing Techniques

### Addressing "Blackmailer" Concerns

Employees often fear that accepting a counteroffer will make them look like they blackmailed the company. Use this reframing:

> "You did not blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways."

This shifts the narrative from manipulation to necessary organizational correction.

## Supervisor Involvement Strategy

### Why Involve Your Supervisor

1. **Resource leverage**: Your supervisor has access to resources you don't
2. **Organizational alignment**: Ensures the solution fits broader company strategy
3. **Shared accountability**: Makes retention a shared problem, not just yours
4. **Career protection**: Demonstrates you're fighting for talent, not losing it

### How to Present to Supervisor

- Frame as: "I have a valued employee who's leaving, and I need your help to save them for the company"
- Present the real issues uncovered (not just surface reasons)
- Propose potential solutions before asking for input
- Make clear this is about organizational benefit, not just your team

# Promotion Cycle Edge Cases

## The Peter Principle Connection

The promotion cycle logic directly relates to the Peter Principle: "In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

- The cycle naturally concludes when an employee reaches a level where they can only "meet requirements"
- This is not a failure—it's the natural endpoint of the cycle
- Forcing promotion beyond this point leads to the need for recycling

## Atrophy Prevention

### Why Atrophy Occurs

When high performers are not promoted:
- They lose motivation (no new challenges)
- Skills stagnate (no growth opportunities)
- Engagement drops (recognition feels absent)
- Performance regresses to the minimum acceptable level

### Prevention Strategies

1. **Lateral moves**: Transfer to different roles with new challenges
2. **Expanded scope**: Add responsibilities without title change
3. **Special projects**: Assign high-visibility, challenging work
4. **Mentorship roles**: Give them teaching/leadership opportunities

# Recycling Implementation Guide

## Preparing for the Recycling Conversation

### Before the Meeting

1. **Document performance**: Have specific examples of below-average performance
2. **Confirm previous success**: Verify they performed well in the prior role
3. **Plan the new role**: Ensure the previous position is available and suitable
4. **Prepare your admission**: Practice taking responsibility for the misjudgment

### During the Meeting

1. **Start with ownership**: "I made a mistake in promoting you too quickly"
2. **Focus on fit**: "This role isn't the right match for your strengths right now"
3. **Present the solution**: "I want you to return to [previous role] where you excelled"
4. **Address the future**: "This isn't the end of your growth—just a reset"
5. **Commit to support**: "I will help you through this transition publicly"

### After the Meeting

1. **Public announcement**: Frame it as a strategic realignment, not a failure
2. **Check-ins**: Frequent support conversations during the transition
3. **Monitor performance**: Confirm they're succeeding in the returned role
4. **Document lessons**: Learn from the misjudgment for future promotion decisions

## Overcoming Stigma

### Why Stigma Exists

- Societal expectation of continuous upward movement
- Management fear of admitting mistakes
- Employee embarrassment about "failure"

### Stigma Reduction Techniques

1. **Transparent communication**: Explain the business rationale openly
2. **Leadership modeling**: Have senior leaders share similar stories
3. **Focus on strengths**: Emphasize what the employee does well
4. **Reframe as strategic**: Position it as placing people where they create most value

## Success Metrics for Recycling

- Employee expresses renewed confidence in role
- Team morale remains stable or improves
- Employee remains with company for at least 12 months post-recycling
- Employee becomes eligible for promotion again within 18-24 months
