# Employee Retention and Career Management

This skill provides procedures for managing the complete employee career lifecycle: retention, promotion, and recycling (demotion when appropriate).

## When to Use

- **Retention**: When a valued, dedicated subordinate announces resignation due to feeling unappreciated (not purely financial motivation)
- **Promotion**: When an employee's performance rating reaches "exceeds requirements"
- **Recycling**: When a promoted employee performs below-average for an extended time

## Retention Procedure

### 1. Immediate Reaction
- Drop what you are doing immediately
- Sit the subordinate down and ask why they are quitting
- Let them talk completely—do not argue, lecture, or panic
- Allow them to deliver rehearsed points, then ask more questions to uncover real issues
- Convey through actions that they are important to you
- **Do not try to change their mind yet**; focus on buying time

### 2. Supervisor Involvement
- Go to your supervisor for help and advice
- Make the resignation your supervisor's problem to ensure they participate in the solution

### 3. Solution Pursuit
- Vigorously pursue every avenue to keep the employee with the firm, including transfers to other departments
- Become the project manager of the solution until settled
- **Principle**: You owe it to the employer to save an employee for the company

### 4. Presenting the Solution
- Return with a solution that addresses real reasons and benefits the company
- Reframe the situation to alleviate fears of being viewed as a "blackmailer":
  - Quote: "You did not blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways."

### 5. Countering External Offers
- If the subordinate has accepted another job, make them "quit again" (renounce the other offer)
- Argument: They have made two commitments—one to a vague potential employer and one to their current team
- Emphasize that commitments to daily colleagues are far stronger than those to a "casual new acquaintance"

## Promotion Performance Cycle

### The Cycle Logic
1. **Initial State**: Employee starts at Job 1 performing at "meets requirements" (average level)
2. **Improvement Phase**: With training and motivation, performance improves to "exceeds requirements"
3. **Promotion Trigger**: Once "exceeds requirements," employee is considered "promotable" and promoted to Job 2
4. **Performance Reset**: Upon entering Job 2, employee initially performs at "meets requirements" due to new challenges
5. **Cycle Repetition**: With experience, employee again improves to "exceeds requirements," leading to another promotion
6. **Cycle Conclusion**: Cycle repeats until employee settles at "meets requirements" and is no longer promoted

### Critical Constraint
- If an employee "exceeds requirements" but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will **atrophy** and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements"

## Employee Recycling Procedure

### When to Apply
- A person has been promoted into a position "so much over their head" that they perform below-average for an extended time
- The employee performed well in their previous role before promotion

### Execution Steps
1. **Identification**: Recognize the employee is over their head
2. **Solution Selection**: Choose to "recycle" rather than terminate
3. **Definition**: Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion
4. **Management Accountability**: Admit management was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness"
5. **Implementation**: Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do
6. **Support System**: Support the employee in the face of likely "embarrassment"
7. **Transparency**: Execute the recycling "openly" to reduce stigma
8. **Expected Outcome**: Embarrassment will be "short-lived" and the employee will regain confidence
9. **Future Value**: Once confidence is regained, the employee becomes an "excellent candidate for another promotion"

### Prohibited Action
- **Do NOT** force the employee to leave the company
- Reject the rationalization: "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake"

## Constraints

- **Retention**: Does not apply if the employee is purely motivated by better financial offers elsewhere
- **Promotion**: Does not apply to "noncompetitors" who have no motivation to do more
- **Recycling**: Requires overcoming societal stigma regarding demotion and management's tendency to view it as personal failure
