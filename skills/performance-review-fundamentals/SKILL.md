# Performance Review Fundamentals

## When to Use This Skill
- Preparing for a performance review
- Conducting a performance review discussion
- Determining performance ratings
- Delivering written reviews to subordinates
- Assessing long-term projects with delayed results

## Core Principle: Fundamental Purpose

The primary goal of any performance review is to **improve the subordinate's performance**:

1. **Focus on Skill Level**: Determine missing skills and find ways to remedy them
2. **Focus on Motivation**: Intensify motivation to move the subordinate to a higher performance curve

Secondary purposes (rewards, discipline, feedback, raises) are valid but secondary.

## Time Offset and Long-Term Assessment

When results lag behind activities:

1. **Analyze Time Offset**: Determine if current output reflects work done in the current period or earlier ("light from distant stars")
2. **Judge Performance Based on Activities**: Give credit for strong activities even if tangible output is absent (e.g., setting up a facility)
3. **Apply Present Value Concept**: Estimate the future payoff of long-term activities and determine their current worth
4. **Balance Short-term vs. Long-term**: Weigh immediate outputs against future-oriented capacity building

## The Potential Trap Rule

**RULE**: The performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the rating accorded to his organization.

1. **Assess Substance over Form**: Evaluate actual performance and real output; ignore "potential" defined as form (knowledge, appearance, acting like a manager)
2. **Apply the Organization Cap**: Compare manager rating to organization rating
3. **Enforce Consequences**: If the business unit lost money, missed forecasts, or slipped schedules, the manager cannot receive a high rating
4. **Prevent Negative Signaling**: Reinforce that performing like a manager is required, not just acting like one

## Review Integrity and Delivery Protocols

### Handling Self-Reviews
- Do not ask for a self-review if you intend to simply retype and return it
- Make an upfront assessment of performance without being prompted by the subordinate
- Preserve the integrity of your judgment

### Handling Upward Feedback
- You may ask subordinates to evaluate your performance
- Clearly state their assessment has only **advisory status**
- Never pretend you and subordinates are equals; you are the leader

### Timing of Written Review Delivery

**Recommended Approach**: Ensure the subordinate has time to work out their reactions to the review content before the discussion.

**Option A: During Discussion (Not Recommended)**
- Risk: Subordinate reads ahead instead of listening
- Risk: Subordinate cannot stop reading to discuss specific points
- Risk: Subordinate walks away feeling they "should have said" something else

**Option B: After Discussion (Not Recommended)**
- Risk: Subordinate may find a phrase they didn't "hear" earlier and react negatively

### Enforcing Quality
- If a review is superficial, lacks analysis, or lacks depth, insist on a rewrite
- The integrity of the performance review system is more important than the subordinate's preference
