# Time Offset and Long-Term Assessment

## The "Light from Distant Stars" Concept

Just as starlight we see today left the star years ago, current organizational output may reflect work done in previous periods.

### Examples of Time Offset

| Activity | Time to Result | Review Period Consideration |
|----------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Setting up new facility | 1-2 years | Credit for activities, not just output |
| R&D project | 2-5 years | Evaluate progress, not final results |
| Process improvement | 6-18 months | Assess implementation quality |
| Sales calls | 1-3 months | Measure activity volume, not just closed deals |

## Present Value Calculation

When evaluating future-oriented activities:

1. **Estimate future payoff**: What will this activity generate over time?
2. **Apply discount rate**: How much is that future value worth today?
3. **Compare to alternatives**: Is this the best use of current resources?

### Example: Process Improvement Initiative

**Scenario**: Engineer spends 6 months improving design methodology.

**Analysis**:
- Immediate output: None visible in current period
- Future payoff: 20% efficiency improvement for all future designs
- Present value: Calculate discounted value of 5 years of 20% gains
- Decision: Rate highly if present value justifies 6-month investment

## Balancing Short-term and Long-term

**Immediate outputs** (e.g., meeting schedule):
- Visible, measurable
- Necessary for current operations
- May not drive future growth

**Future-oriented activities** (e.g., improving methods):
- Delayed payoff
- Builds organizational capability
- Critical for long-term success

**Rating guidance**:
- Give credit for strong future-oriented work
- Do not penalize lack of immediate results when building capacity
- Weigh both dimensions in final assessment
