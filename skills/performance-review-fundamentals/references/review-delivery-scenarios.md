# Review Delivery Scenarios

## Scenario 1: High Performer Expects Praise

**Situation**: Employee has exceeded expectations and expects a glowing review.

**Mistake**: Deliver review during meeting without prior processing time.

**Consequence**: Employee reads ahead, misses developmental feedback, leaves feeling they "should have said" something.

**Correct Approach**:
1. Provide written review 1-2 days before meeting
2. Allow time for processing
3. Use meeting for discussion, not revelation

## Scenario 2: Poor Performer in Denial

**Situation**: Employee believes they are performing well.

**Mistake**: Rely on self-review to understand their perspective.

**Consequence**: You appear unaware, employee feels cheated when you disagree.

**Correct Approach**:
1. Conduct your own assessment first
2. Document specific examples and facts
3. Present your assessment directly
4. Use self-review only for understanding their view, not as input to your judgment

## Scenario 3: New Manager Seeking Feedback

**Situation**: First-time manager wants to know how they're doing as a leader.

**Mistake**: Treat upward feedback as equal to your judgment.

**Consequence**: Erodes authority, creates confusion about leadership role.

**Correct Approach**:
1. Request upward feedback
2. Clearly label it "advisory status only"
3. Thank them for input
4. Make your own independent assessment
5. Maintain position as final decision-maker
