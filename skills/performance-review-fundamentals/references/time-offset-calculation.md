# Time Offset Calculation Examples

## Example 1: R&D Project Manager

**Situation**: Manager spent the entire year setting up a new research facility from scratch. No products shipped, no revenue generated.

**Traditional Review**: Poor rating—no output

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Activities: Strong (facility setup, team hiring, process design)
- Output lag: 2-3 years (R&D cycle)
- Present value calculation: Facility will enable $50M in new products over 5 years
- Current value: Significant investment in future capacity

**Adjusted Review**: Good to excellent rating—building critical future capability

## Example 2: Sales Executive

**Situation**: Executive implemented a new sales methodology and CRM system. Sales declined 15% during implementation year.

**Traditional Review**: Poor rating—sales down

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Activities: Strong (system implementation, training, process redesign)
- Output lag: 6-12 months
- Present value calculation: New system expected to increase sales efficiency by 30% annually
- Current value: Investment that will compound

**Adjusted Review**: Meets requirements—short-term pain for long-term gain

## Example 3: Operations Manager

**Situation**: Manager met all production targets but did not invest in process improvements or capacity building.

**Traditional Review**: Excellent rating—all targets met

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Activities: Weak (no forward-looking initiatives)
- Output: Strong (current targets met)
- Future risk: No capacity for growth, efficiency will decline
- Present value: Low—no future value being created

**Adjusted Review**: Meets requirements—good current performance, poor future positioning

## Present Value Formula

```
Present Value = (Future Annual Benefit × Years of Benefit) / (1 + Discount Rate)^Years
```

**Simplified Managerial Version**:
- Estimate total future benefit
- Apply confidence factor (0.5 to 0.9 based on risk)
- Apply time factor (closer = higher value)
- Compare to current opportunity cost
