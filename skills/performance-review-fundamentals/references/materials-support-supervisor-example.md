# Materials Support Supervisor Performance Evaluation Example

This example demonstrates how to apply performance review fundamentals to a specific management role.

## Role Context
- **Position**: Materials Support Supervisor
- **Transition Context**: Finance to Manufacturing
- **Review Period**: 2/82 - 8/82

## Core Responsibilities
- Managing the production planning process
- Managing the manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

## Evaluation Framework

### Production Planning Performance
- Check for significant process changes during the review period
- Verify site coordination and administrative activity efficiency
- Rating: "good" if sites are well coordinated and activities are efficiently done

### Manufacturing Specifications Performance

#### Goal Setting Assessment
**Negative Indicators:**
- Difficulty setting objectives and key results
- "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews (e.g., March review)
- Lack of definitive statement on system direction

**Consequence:**
Falling into the trap of "working on" things without reaching objectives.

#### Meeting Effectiveness Assessment
**Negative Indicator:**
Satisfaction that having a meeting on a subject constitutes progress.

**Corrective Action:**
Employee must define specific results to accomplish **prior** to each meeting.

### Strengths & Background Utilization
- Evaluate speed of learning (e.g., getting up to speed quickly to take over from predecessor effectively)
- Evaluate utilization of prior background (e.g., finance) to assist other areas voluntarily (e.g., helping Purchasing group sort out finance problems)

## Promotion Eligibility Criteria

### Current Status
Promotion to next management level is denied if specific criteria are not met, regardless of desire.

### Required Capabilities
- Must be able to take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system) and show results
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of the way to achieve those goals

### Independence Requirement
- Employee must be the "primary driver"
- Supervisor helps only when needed
- Promotion is contingent on demonstrating capability for independent work

## Final Rating Determination

### Meets Requirements
Assigned if capable of doing current job, but acknowledging specific areas (goal setting, defining ways of accomplishing tasks) need improvement.

### Context Adjustment
Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance.
