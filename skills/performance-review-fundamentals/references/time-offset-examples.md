# Time Offset Examples

## "Light from Distant Stars" Analogy

Just as we see stars as they were years ago due to light travel time, current organizational output may reflect work done months or years earlier.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Facility Setup
- **Activity:** Setting up a manufacturing facility from scratch
- **Immediate Output:** Minimal or none
- **Future Value:** High (production capacity for years)
- **Assessment:** Give credit for strong activities despite lack of immediate tangible output

### Scenario 2: Process Improvement
- **Activity:** Improving design methods
- **Immediate Output:** May slow current production
- **Future Value:** Significant efficiency gains
- **Assessment:** Apply present value calculation to determine current significance

### Scenario 3: Meeting Schedule
- **Activity:** Coordinating site meetings
- **Immediate Output:** Meetings held on schedule
- **Future Value:** Low (administrative task)
- **Assessment:** Weigh less heavily than future-oriented activities
