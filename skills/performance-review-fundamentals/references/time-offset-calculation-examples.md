# Time Offset Calculation Examples

## Example 1: R&D Project Manager

**Scenario**: Manager spent the entire year setting up a new research facility. No products shipped during the review period.

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Current output: Zero tangible products
- Activities: High (facility setup, team hiring, process design)
- Future value: Facility expected to generate $50M in products over next 5 years
- Present value calculation: $50M / 5 years = $10M/year value
- **Decision**: Rate highly based on activities and future value, not current output

## Example 2: Manufacturing Process Engineer

**Scenario**: Engineer spent year redesigning production line. Current quarter output decreased 15% due to transition.

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Current output: Decreased (negative short-term)
- Activities: High (process redesign, equipment selection, training)
- Future value: Expected 30% efficiency improvement, saving $5M annually
- Present value calculation: $5M/year savings starting next year
- **Decision**: Rate based on future value creation, acknowledge short-term dip as investment

## Example 3: Sales Manager

**Scenario**: Sales manager restructured territory assignments. Current quarter sales flat despite market growth.

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Current output: Flat (below expectations)
- Activities: High (territory analysis, rep reassignment, compensation redesign)
- Future value: Expected 20% sales increase in Q3-Q4
- Present value calculation: 20% increase on $100M = $20M additional revenue
- **Decision**: Rate based on strategic activities and projected future performance

## Example 4: Product Manager (Negative Example)

**Scenario**: Product manager claims to be "building for the future" but has no concrete plans, just "exploring opportunities."

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Current output: Low
- Activities: Vague, undefined
- Future value: Cannot be estimated (no specific goals or plans)
- **Decision**: Rate poorly - future value must be quantifiable, not a vague excuse for lack of output
