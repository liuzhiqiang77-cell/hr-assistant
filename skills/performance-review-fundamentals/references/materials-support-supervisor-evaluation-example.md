# Materials Support Supervisor Performance Evaluation Example

This example demonstrates how to apply performance review fundamentals to a specific management role.

## Core Responsibilities
- Managing the production planning process
- Managing the manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

## Evaluation Framework

### Production Planning Performance
- Check for significant process changes during the review period
- Verify site coordination and administrative activity efficiency
- **Rating**: 'good' if sites are well coordinated and activities are efficiently done

### Manufacturing Specifications Performance

**Goal Setting Assessment:**
- Determine if the employee defines 'clear, concise, and specific goals'
- *Negative Indicators*:
  - Difficulty setting objectives and key results
  - 'Mushy' conclusions to system reviews (e.g., March review)
  - Lack of definitive statement on system direction
- *Consequence*: Falling into the trap of 'working on' things without reaching objectives

**Meeting Effectiveness Assessment:**
- Determine if the employee confuses holding meetings with actual progress
- *Negative Indicator*: Satisfaction that having a meeting on a subject constitutes progress
- *Corrective Action*: Employee must define specific results to accomplish *prior* to each meeting

### Strengths & Background Utilization
- Evaluate speed of learning (e.g., getting up to speed quickly to take over from predecessor)
- Evaluate utilization of prior background (e.g., finance) to assist other areas voluntarily

### Promotion Eligibility

**Current Status**: Promotion to next management level is denied if specific criteria are not met.

**Required Capabilities:**
- Must be able to take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system) and show results
- **Required Actions**:
  - Clear and concise breakdown of problems
  - Identification of goals
  - Establishment of the way to achieve those goals

**Independence Requirement:**
- Employee must be the 'primary driver'
- Supervisor helps only when needed
- Promotion is contingent on demonstrating capability for independent work

### Final Rating Determination
- **Meets Requirements**: Assigned if capable of doing current job, but acknowledging specific areas (goal setting, defining ways of accomplishing tasks) need improvement
- **Context Adjustment**: Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance

## Key Evaluation Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Goal_Clarity | Qualitative | Ability to define clear, concise, and specific goals vs. mushy conclusions |
| Meeting_Effectiveness | Qualitative | Distinction between having a meeting and achieving specific results |
| Project_Independence | Boolean | Ability to be the primary driver on complex projects without constant supervision |
