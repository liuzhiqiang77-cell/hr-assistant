# Potential Trap Rule Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Outstanding Manager, Failing Organization

**Manager Performance**:
- Excellent leadership and team building
- Strong individual technical contributions
- Great communication and presentation skills
- "Looks like a manager"

**Organization Performance**:
- Revenue missed by 40%
- Major product launch delayed 6 months
- Customer satisfaction dropped 15%
- Key employees departed

**Application of Potential Trap Rule**:
- Manager's proposed rating: "Outstanding"
- Organization's rating: "Does Not Meet Requirements"
- **Corrected manager rating**: "Does Not Meet Requirements" (cannot exceed organization)

**Rationale**: The manager is responsible for the organization's output. "Potential" without results is insufficient.

## Scenario 2: External Factors, Poor Organization Results

**Manager Performance**:
- Solid execution within control
- Good team management
- Adequate individual contribution

**Organization Performance**:
- Revenue missed due to industry-wide recession
- Supply chain disruptions from natural disaster
- Regulatory changes increasing costs

**Application of Potential Trap Rule**:
- Manager's proposed rating: "Exceeds Requirements"
- Organization's rating: "Does Not Meet Requirements"
- **Corrected manager rating**: "Does Not Meet Requirements"

**Note**: The rule applies strictly even with external factors. This reinforces that managers must anticipate and mitigate external risks.

## Scenario 3: Average Manager, Successful Organization

**Manager Performance**:
- Adequate but not inspired leadership
- Meets basic expectations
- Minimal innovation or improvement

**Organization Performance**:
- Revenue exceeded by 10%
- All projects on schedule
- Strong customer satisfaction

**Application of Potential Trap Rule**:
- Manager's proposed rating: "Meets Requirements"
- Organization's rating: "Exceeds Requirements"
- **Corrected manager rating**: "Meets Requirements" (allowed to be lower than organization)

**Rationale**: The manager can be rated lower than the organization, but never higher.
