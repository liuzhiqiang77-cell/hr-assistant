# Materials Support Supervisor Performance Evaluation Example

This example demonstrates application of performance review fundamentals to a specific management role transition (finance to manufacturing).

## Core Responsibilities

- Managing the production planning process
- Managing the manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

## Evaluation Framework

### 1. Production Planning Performance

**Positive Indicators:**
- Significant process changes during review period
- Site coordination is effective
- Administrative activities are efficient

**Rating:** "Good" if sites are well coordinated and activities are efficiently done.

### 2. Manufacturing Specifications Performance

#### Goal Setting Assessment

**Negative Indicators:**
- Difficulty setting objectives and key results
- "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews (e.g., March review)
- Lack of definitive statement on system direction

**Consequence:** Falling into the trap of "working on" things without reaching objectives.

#### Meeting Effectiveness Assessment

**Negative Indicator:** Satisfaction that having a meeting on a subject constitutes progress.

**Corrective Action:** Employee must define specific results to accomplish **prior** to each meeting.

### 3. Strengths & Background Utilization

- **Speed of learning:** Getting up to speed quickly to take over from predecessor effectively
- **Background utilization:** Using prior background (e.g., finance) to assist other areas voluntarily (e.g., helping Purchasing group sort out finance problems)

### 4. Promotion Eligibility Criteria

**Current Status:** Promotion to next management level is denied if specific criteria are not met.

**Required Capabilities:**
- Must be able to take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system) and show results
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of the way to achieve those goals

**Independence Requirement:** Employee must be the "primary driver"; supervisor helps only when needed. Promotion is contingent on demonstrating capability for independent work.

### 5. Final Rating Determination

**"Meets Requirements":** Assigned if capable of doing current job, but acknowledging specific areas (goal setting, defining ways of accomplishing tasks) need improvement.

**Context Adjustment:** Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance.

## Key Variables

- `Goal_Clarity` (Qualitative): Ability to define clear, concise, and specific goals vs. mushy conclusions
- `Meeting_Effectiveness` (Qualitative): Distinction between having a meeting and achieving specific results
- `Project_Independence` (Boolean): Ability to be the primary driver on complex projects without constant supervision

## Signatories Required

- Immediate Supervisor
- Approving Supervisor
- Matrix Manager
- Personnel Administrator
