# Performance Indicator Design

## When to Use
- Designing or selecting performance metrics
- Creating management dashboards
- Establishing KPI systems
- Preventing metric gaming or over-optimization

## Procedure

### 1. Apply the Attention Principle
- Recognize indicators direct attention (like steering a bicycle)
- "You will probably steer it where you are looking"
- Design metrics to focus attention on desired outcomes

### 2. Guard Against Overreaction
- Be aware that single metrics can lead to extreme behaviors
- Example: Driving inventory too low creates shortages
- Balance competing objectives

### 3. Implement Paired Indicators
- Always pair indicators to measure both effect and counter-effect
- Maintain optimum middle ground

**Example Pairs**
- Inventory Levels ↔ Incidence of Shortages
- Completion Date ↔ Capability
- (Prevents rushing OR perfectionism)

### 4. Follow Administrative Indicator Criteria

**Rule 1**: Any measurement is better than none

**Rule 2**: Measure Output, Not Activity
- Output = Results
- Activity = Effort
- Example: Measure orders obtained, not calls made

**Rule 3**: Measure Physical/Countable Things
- Examples: Vouchers processed, square feet cleaned, sales orders entered, transactions processed, people hired, items managed

### 5. Apply Administrative Pairing Strategy

Pair Quantity/Output indicators with Quality indicators:

| Domain | Quantity Indicator | Quality Indicator |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Accounts Payable | # Vouchers processed | # Errors found |
| Custodial | # Square feet cleaned | Quality rating by senior manager |
| Production | Units produced | Defect rate |
| Sales | Orders obtained | Customer satisfaction |
