## Daily Review Checklist Template

### Morning Operations Review

- [ ] Analyze yesterday's variance
- [ ] Check raw material inventory levels

- **Equipment**: Repair / Reroute / Replace
- **Manpower**: Reallocate / Temp hire / Redistribute
- **Quality**: Coaching / Retraining / Process adjustment

## Indicator Implementation Steps

1. **Define objective**: What behavior or outcome are you trying to drive?
2. **Identify primary metric**: What directly measures success?
3. **Identify counter metric**: What could go wrong if we optimize only the primary?
4. **Set targets**: Define acceptable ranges for both metrics
5. **Establish baseline**: Measure current performance
6. **Implement tracking**: Set up data collection
7. **Review and adjust**: Regularly evaluate indicator effectiveness

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Measuring activity instead of output**: Counting hours instead of results
2. **Single metric focus**: Optimizing one dimension at expense of others
3. **Gaming the metric**: Behavior that improves the metric without improving real performance
4. **Too many metrics**: Losing focus on what matters
5. **Vague definitions**: Metrics that can be interpreted differently

## Indicator Quality Test

For any proposed indicator, ask:
- Is it countable or objectively measurable?
- Does it measure results, not effort?
- Is it paired with a counter-metric?
- Will improving this indicator improve actual performance?
- Is it clear what action to take based on this indicator?
