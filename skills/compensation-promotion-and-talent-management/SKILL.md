# Compensation, Promotion, and Talent Management

## When to Use
- Designing or reviewing compensation structures for managers
- Evaluating employees for promotion
- Managing employees who are struggling after promotion
- Making decisions about salary increases and bonuses

## Middle Manager Compensation System Design

### Performance Bonus (Variable Pay)

1. **Determine Bonus Percentage** based on Total Compensation:
   - **Middle Manager**: 10% to 25% of total compensation
   - **Senior Manager**: Up to 50% of total compensation
   - *Reasoning*: Higher earners have less material utility for incremental dollars; higher percentage needed for feedback while avoiding hardship from fluctuations

2. **Define Bonus Factors** (Scope):
   - Identify if performance is Team-based or Individual-based
   - If Team-based, define the team (Project team, Division, or Entire Corporation)
   - **Recommended 3-Factor Split** (e.g., splitting 20% total comp):
     1. Individual Performance (judged by supervisor)
     2. Immediate Team Objective Performance (e.g., department)
     3. Overall Corporate Financial Performance

3. **Establish Timing**:
   - Pay bonus close enough to the work time so the subordinate remembers why it was awarded
   - Account for cause/effect time offsets

4. **Select Metrics**:
   - Options: Countable items (financial), Measurable objectives, or Subjective elements
   - Caution: Subjective elements may lead to a "beauty contest"

### Salary Administration (Base Pay)

1. **Select Administration Scheme**:
   - **Option A: Experience-Only**: Pay based strictly on time (ignores merit)
   - **Option B: Merit-Only**: Hard to ignore experience
   - **Option C: Compromise (Recommended)**: "Family of curves"
     * Starts everyone at same salary level
     * Individuals move up at different speeds based on performance
     * Shape approximates experience-only curve but allows variance

2. **Implement Competitive Ranking** (Required for Merit):
   - Accept that merit-based systems require competitive, comparative evaluation
   - Principle: If someone is first, someone else must be last

## Promotion Performance Cycle Logic

1. **Initial State**: Employee starts at Job 1 performing at "meets requirements" (average)
2. **Improvement Phase**: With training and motivation, performance improves to "exceeds requirements" (above-average)
3. **Promotion Trigger**: Once employee "exceeds requirements," they are "promotable" and promoted to Job 2
4. **Performance Reset**: Upon entering Job 2, employee initially performs at "meets requirements" due to new challenges
5. **Cycle Repetition**: With experience, employee again improves to "exceeds requirements," leading to another promotion
6. **Cycle Conclusion**: Cycle repeats until employee settles at "meets requirements" and is no longer promoted (reaching their "level of incompetence")
7. **Critical Constraint**: If an employee "exceeds requirements" but is NOT promoted, they will "atrophy" and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements"

## Employee Recycling Procedure

Use when a promoted employee performs below-average for an extended time.

1. **Identification**: Recognize that a person has been promoted into a position "so much over his head" that they perform below-average for an extended time
2. **Solution Selection**: Choose to "recycle" the employee rather than terminate them
3. **Definition of Recycling**: Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion
4. **Management Accountability**: Management must admit it was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness"
5. **Implementation**: Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do
6. **Support System**: Support the employee in the face of likely "embarrassment"
7. **Transparency**: Execute the recycling "openly" to reduce stigma
8. **Expected Outcome**: Embarrassment will be "short-lived" and the employee will regain confidence
9. **Future Value**: Once confidence is regained, the employee becomes an "excellent candidate for another promotion"
10. **Prohibited Action**: Do NOT force the employee to leave the company
