# Competitive Sports Approach Implementation

## Establishing the Arena of Competition

### Step 1: Define Clear Rules of the Game

- What constitutes success?
- How will performance be measured?
- What are the boundaries of acceptable behavior?
- How often will scores be updated?

### Step 2: Create Visible Metrics

**Types of Metrics:**
- Individual performance scores
- Team comparisons
- Progress against personal bests
- Leaderboards (if appropriate)

**Example Scoring Systems:**
- Building maintenance ratings (1-10 scale)
- Sales quotas with percentage achievement
- Code quality metrics
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Project completion time vs. target

### Step 3: Enable Self-Measurement

Employees should be able to:
- See their own score at any time
- Compare to peers/standards
- Track progress over time
- Understand what actions improve their score

## Manager as Coach

### Behaviors to Adopt:

1. **No Credit Taking**
   - Attribute all success to the team/individuals
   - Say "You did this" not "We did this" (when referring to team output)
   - Build trust by deflecting credit

2. **Tough but Fair Critique**
   - Provide honest, direct feedback on performance
   - Focus on improvement, not punishment
   - Push for personal best, not just "good enough"

3. **Task-Relevant Focus**
   - Redirect attention from perks (office size, title) to output
   - Frame all feedback in terms of performance metrics
   - Celebrate achievements that matter to the work

### Coaching Language Examples:

- "You're capable of more. Here's what I see..."
- "That's good, but I know you can do better. Here's how..."
- "This is your personal best. Now let's set the next target."
- "The scoreboard shows where we are. What do we need to do to improve?"

## Managing Failure Dynamics

### The Spectrum of Failure Response:

| **Healthy Response** | **Unhealthy Response** |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Analyze what went wrong | Internalize failure as identity |
| Learn and adjust | Avoid future challenges |
| Try again with new approach | Quit or withdraw |
| Seek feedback on improvement | Blame external factors |

### Normalizing Failure:

- Explicitly state that failure is expected ~50% of the time with stretch goals
- Celebrate the effort, not just the outcome
- Conduct post-mortems focused on learning, not blame
- Share stories of famous failures that led to later success
- Model your own relationship with failure

### Preventing Destructive Fear:

**Warning Signs:**
- Excessive risk avoidance
- Hiding mistakes or information
- Undermining peers to look better
- Refusing to take on challenges

**Interventions:**
- Redefine success as effort + learning
- Separate worth from performance
- Provide psychological safety
- Adjust goal difficulty if needed
