# Behavioral Classification: The Peg/Ring Experiment

## Background

This experiment classifies individuals based on their risk-taking behavior and need for achievement.

## Three Types

### Gamblers
- **Risk**: High
- **Influence on outcome**: None
- **Behavior**: Takes risks regardless of control
- **Motivation**: Thrill of risk, not achievement

### Conservatives
- **Risk**: Very little
- **Influence on outcome**: High control
- **Behavior**: Avoids risk, stays within comfort zone
- **Motivation**: Security, not achievement

### Achievers
- **Risk**: Moderate
- **Influence on outcome**: Some control
- **Behavior**: Challenges themselves at the boundary of capability
- **Motivation**: Testing limits, personal achievement

## Management Implications

- **Gamblers**: Not suitable for achievement-driven roles; risk is uncontrolled
- **Conservatives**: May need encouragement to stretch; good for stability-focused roles
- **Achievers**: Ideal for peak performance; naturally seek boundary challenges

## Identifying Achievers

Look for individuals who:
- Choose tasks with 50% success probability
- Seek feedback on performance
- Persist after failure
- Take calculated risks
- Focus on personal improvement, not just winning
