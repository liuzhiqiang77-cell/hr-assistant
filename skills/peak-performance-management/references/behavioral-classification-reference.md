# Behavioral Classification Reference

## Peg/Ring Experiment: Achievement Classification

Based on behavioral research, individuals can be classified by their risk-taking approach:

### Gamblers
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Influence on Outcome:** None
- **Behavior:** Takes risks regardless of ability to affect results
- **Management:** Not suitable for achievement-based roles

### Conservatives
- **Risk Level:** Very little
- **Influence on Outcome:** High control, but low ambition
- **Behavior:** Avoids challenge, stays within comfort zone
- **Management:** May need encouragement to stretch

### Achievers
- **Risk Level:** Moderate to High
- **Influence on Outcome:** Works at boundary of capability
- **Behavior:** Challenges self at 50% success probability
- **Management:** Ideal for peak performance initiatives

## Competence vs Achievement Drivers

| Aspect | Competence-Driven | Achievement-Driven |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | Job/task mastery | Abstract achievement in all endeavors |
| **Behavior** | Sharpening own skill, beating personal best | Testing limits of capability |
| **Example** | Violinist practicing daily | Entrepreneur starting multiple ventures |
| **Goal Setting** | Progressive skill improvement | Boundary-pushing challenges |
| **Management** | Provide skill development opportunities | Provide stretch goals with 50% success rate |

## MBO Implementation Guidelines

### Goal Difficulty Formula

**Optimal Goal Success Probability = 50%**

**Why this works:**
- Goals too easy: No motivation, complacency
- Goals too hard: Demotivation, learned helplessness
- Goals at 50%: Maximum effort, peak output even with frequent failure

**Implementation steps:**
1. Assess current capability level
2. Identify next performance boundary
3. Set goal that requires maximum effort to achieve
4. Accept that 50% failure rate is optimal for growth
5. Celebrate effort and learning, not just success

### Culture Design Elements

**Output-Centered Culture Characteristics:**
- Performance metrics visible and tracked
- Results celebrated publicly
- Promotions based on output, not tenure or knowledge
- Meetings focus on what was produced, not what was learned
- Success stories highlight tangible achievements

**Knowledge-Centered Culture Pitfalls:**
- Knowing valued over doing
- Theoretical expertise rewarded without practical application
- "Smart" people who produce little valued over "practical" people who deliver
- Leads to low actual achievement despite high perceived competence
