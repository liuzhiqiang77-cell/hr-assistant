# Performance Diagnosis and Adaptive Management

## When to Use
- An employee is not performing their job effectively
- You need to determine whether a performance issue is due to capability or motivation
- You must decide between hands-on or hands-off management for a specific task
- A subordinate is struggling with new responsibilities

## Diagnosing Performance Failure (Can't vs. Won't)

### Step 1: Identify the Performance Issue
Confirm that the person is not doing their job effectively.

### Step 2: Apply the "Life or Death" Mental Test
Ask yourself: **"If the person's life depended on doing the work, could he do it?"**

### Step 3: Evaluate the Answer
- **If YES**: The person is capable but NOT motivated. They "won't do it."
  - **Solution**: Apply motivation strategies
- **If NO**: The person is NOT capable. They "can't do it."
  - **Solution**: Provide training

### Key Principle
These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job. Everything else is ineffective unless individuals try to offer their best.

## Task-Relevant Maturity Management Style

### Step 1: Assess Task-Relevant Maturity
Evaluate the employee's maturity level specifically for the task at hand, not their overall maturity.

### Step 2: Select Management Style

**For Immature Employees (Hands-On Training)**
- Apply hands-on training
- **Critical Constraint**: Do NOT allow the employee to "make their own mistakes" to learn
- **Reasoning**: The subordinate's tuition is paid by their customers, which is wrong

**For Mature Employees (Delegate Approach)**
- Apply a delegate approach (hands-off management)
- Trust the employee to handle the task independently

### Contextual Insight
This decision-making process distinguishes the top 5% of managers who think deeply about their craft from the 95% who do not.
