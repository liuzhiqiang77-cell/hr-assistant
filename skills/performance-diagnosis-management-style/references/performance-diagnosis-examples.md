# Performance Diagnosis Examples

## Example 1: Sales Representative Not Meeting Quota

**Situation**: Sales rep consistently misses monthly targets.

**Life or Death Test**: "If their life depended on closing this deal, could they do it?"

**Analysis**:
- If YES: They know how to sell but lack motivation. Solution: Incentive restructuring, career path discussion, or addressing burnout.
- If NO: They lack sales skills. Solution: Sales training, shadowing top performers, product knowledge courses.

## Example 2: Engineer Missing Deadlines

**Situation**: Engineer delivers code late despite working long hours.

**Life or Death Test**: "If their life depended on delivering on time, could they do it?"

**Analysis**:
- If YES: They're capable but unmotivated. Solution: Recognition programs, autonomy, or addressing team dynamics.
- If NO: They lack time management or technical skills. Solution: Project management training, code review pairing, technical mentoring.
