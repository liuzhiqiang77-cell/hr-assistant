# Performance Diagnosis and Management Style

## Diagnosing Performance Failure (Can't vs. Won't)

Use this diagnostic when an individual is not performing their job and the root cause is not external (e.g., equipment failure).

### The Life or Death Mental Test

1. Identify the performance issue: The person is not doing their job.
2. Ask the critical question: "If the person's life depended on doing the work, could they do it?"
3. Evaluate the answer:
   - **YES**: The person is capable but NOT motivated. They "won't do it" (motivation issue).
   - **NO**: The person is NOT capable. They "can't do it" (capability issue).
4. Select the managerial intervention:
   - For "Can't do it" (Capability): Use Training.
   - For "Won't do it" (Motivation): Use Motivation strategies.

**Key Insight**: These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job. All other interventions are ineffective unless individuals try to offer their best.

## Task-Relevant Maturity Management Style

Use this when deciding between hands-on or hands-off management for a specific task.

### Assessment and Action

1. Assess the employee's maturity level specifically for the task at hand (Task-Relevant Maturity).
2. Determine the appropriate management style:
   - **IF employee is immature in the task**:
     - Apply **hands-on training**.
     - **Critical constraint**: Do NOT allow the employee to "make their own mistakes" to learn.
     - **Reasoning**: The subordinate's tuition is paid by their customers, which is absolutely wrong.
   - **IF employee is more mature in the task**:
     - Apply a **delegate approach** (hands-off management).

### Decision Quality Indicator

This decision-making process distinguishes the top 5% of managers who think deeply about their craft from the 95% who do not.

## Integration of Approaches

- Use the "Can't vs. Won't" diagnostic to identify the root cause.
- Use Task-Relevant Maturity to determine the appropriate management style for the specific task.
- For "Can't" issues with immature employees: Use hands-on training.
- For "Won't" issues with mature employees: Use motivation strategies with delegation.
