# Management by Objectives (MBO) Implementation

## Goal Setting Principles

### Probability Target
- Set objectives at a difficulty level where the individual has only a "fifty-fifty chance" of making them
- Even if they push hard, success should not be guaranteed
- Rationale: Output tends to be greater when striving for a level beyond immediate grasp

### Objective Characteristics
- Specific and measurable
- Challenging but achievable
- Time-bound
- Aligned with organizational goals

### Process Steps
1. **Collaborative Goal Setting**: Manager and subordinate agree on objectives together
2. **Regular Review**: Check progress periodically, adjust if needed
3. **Feedback Loop**: Provide continuous feedback on performance
4. **Evaluation**: Assess results against objectives at end of period

## Common Pitfalls
- Setting goals too easy (no motivation stretch)
- Setting goals impossible (demotivating)
- Lack of resources to achieve goals
- Inflexible goals when circumstances change

## Output-Centered Culture Design

### Values to Emphasize
- Tangible results are highly valued and esteemed
- Abstract knowledge without application gets little recognition
- "What have you produced?" matters more than "What do you know?"

### Behaviors to Reward
- Completed projects and deliverables
- Measurable improvements
- Problem-solving with actual outcomes
- Customer-facing results

### Behaviors to De-emphasize
- Theoretical knowledge without application
- Process over results
- Tenure without achievement
- Credentials without performance
