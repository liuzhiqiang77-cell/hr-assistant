# Strategic Career and Competitive Management

## When to Use This Skill
- Managing your career in a globalized, competitive job market
- Facing declining market share due to superior or cheaper competition
- Operating in commoditized industries where products are indistinguishable
- Seeking competitive advantage through speed and responsiveness
- Evaluating whether to exit a declining business segment

## Part 1: Career Management as a Sole Proprietor

### Adopt the Sole Proprietor Mindset

You are not an employee. You are a business with one employee: yourself.

**Key Realities**:
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- Your rivals are not just fellow workers—they are outnumbered by people in competing organizations (ratios of 1000:1, 100,000:1, or 1,000,000:1)
- "Nobody owes you a career"—you own it as a sole proprietor
- Globalization and the information revolution have eliminated job security

### Daily Career Management Actions

1. **Continually retain your individual competitive advantage**
2. **Enhance your value every day**
3. **Hone your competitive advantage**
4. **Learn and adapt constantly**
5. **Be willing to move**—job to job, industry to industry if necessary
6. **Retrench if needed**—start again when required

### The Three Self-Assessment Questions

**Question 1: Value Addition**
- Ask: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"
- Action: Continually look for ways to make things truly better in your department
- Principle: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization"
- Standard: Every hour should increase the output or value of people you're responsible for

**Question 2: Connectivity**
- Ask: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?" (inside company and industry)
- Check: Do not wait for supervisor to interpret events
- Status: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people"

**Question 3: Innovation**
- Ask: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"
- Action: Personally try new things; don't just read about them
- Warning: Don't wait for others to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of it

### Address Internal Threats

**In Slow/No-Growth Environments**:
- Identify threat: Ambitious junior employees blocked by your position
- Anticipate boss's dilemma: Choose between retaining you (good job, blocking others) or promoting junior
- Take responsibility: Avoid being "in the way"—move up or move on

## Part 2: Strategic Pivot to Core Strengths

### When to Consider a Strategic Pivot

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Market share is declining due to superior/cheaper competition
- Competitors have perfected technological capability and manufacturing prowess
- Price competition has forced prices down to a level causing "major losses"
- You are no longer the best at what you do

### The "Lead with Strength" Heuristic

> "Being second best in a tough environment is just not good enough."

### Execute Strategic Exit

1. **Assess Competitive Threat**: Identify if competitors offer aggressively priced, high-quality products eroding your market share
2. **Evaluate Financial Viability**: Determine if the business is incurring major losses
3. **Recognize Emotional Difficulty**: Accept that backing out may be hard, especially if it's the business you were founded upon
4. **Execute Exit**: Leave the business that is no longer your strength
5. **Focus Resources**: Shift entirely to another business where you are "best at"
6. **Implement Operational Changes**:
   - Move and redeploy employees
   - Let some employees go
   - Shutter factories or facilities

### Contextual Understanding

This competitive assault is likely "just one wave of a much larger tide—the tide of globalization" where business knows no national boundaries.

## Part 3: Time as Competitive Advantage via Digital Communication

### Analyze Market Conditions

**Acknowledge Globalization**:
- Capital and work can go anywhere on earth
- Domestic markets can be supplied from anywhere
- Geographic boundaries no longer protect businesses

**Identify Commodity Status**:
- When products and services become "largely indistinguishable from each other"
- Recognize that "all there is by the way of competitive advantage is time"

### Leverage Digital Communication

**Use Computer-to-Computer Electronic Messaging**:

**Effect 1: Speed**
- "Turns days into minutes"
- Dramatically reduces communication latency
- Enables faster decision-making and response

**Effect 2: Reach**
- Originator can reach "dozens or more" co-workers with same effort as reaching one
- Scales communication without linear effort increase
- Enables broad organizational alignment

### Resulting Organizational State

**Transparency**:
- "A lot more people know what's going on in your business than did before"
- Information flows faster and more widely
- Reduces information asymmetry

**Global Proximity**:
- Replicates communication ease of physical proximity (e.g., Japanese office with big table)
- Achieved globally via electronic means
- Enables coordinated global operations

### Expand to Digital Formats

Recognize that the following are going digital:
- Sound
- Photos
- Movies
- Books
- Financial services

**Implication**: Anything digital can be "shipped around the world just as fast as it can be shipped down the hall."

### Operational Implication

> "The information revolution does away with hiding places anywhere, in any line of work."
