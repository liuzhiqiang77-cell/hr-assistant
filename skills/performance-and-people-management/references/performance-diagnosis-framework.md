# Employee Performance Diagnosis: Detailed Framework

## Step-by-Step Diagnosis Process

### Step 1: Define Expected Performance
- Clear job description with measurable outputs
- Specific performance standards and metrics
- Behavioral expectations for the role

### Step 2: Observe Actual Performance
- Document specific instances of underperformance
- Gather objective data (metrics, deadlines missed, quality issues)
- Collect feedback from peers and customers

### Step 3: Identify Gap
- Compare actual vs expected performance
- Quantify the performance gap
- Determine impact on team/organization

### Step 4: Determine Root Cause

#### Capability Indicators (Can't Do)
- Lacks necessary skills or knowledge
- Unable to perform task even with effort
- Performance improves with training
- Consistent failure across similar tasks
- Expresses frustration or confusion

#### Motivation Indicators (Won't Do)
- Has demonstrated capability in the past
- Performance varies with effort or interest
- Selective about which tasks to perform well
- Responds to incentives or consequences
- Expresses disinterest or resistance

### Step 5: Select and Implement Intervention

#### For Capability Issues:
1. **Assess trainability**: Can the capability be developed?
2. **Provide training**: Formal training, mentoring, coaching
3. **Set learning goals**: Specific, measurable skill development targets
4. **Monitor progress**: Regular check-ins on skill application
5. **Adjust role**: If capability cannot be developed, consider reassignment

#### For Motivation Issues:
1. **Identify barriers**: Personal, environmental, or organizational factors
2. **Clarify expectations**: Re-state what success looks like
3. **Provide incentives**: Recognition, rewards, career opportunities
4. **Set consequences**: Clear outcomes for continued underperformance
5. **Address environment**: Remove obstacles, provide resources

### Step 6: Monitor and Adjust
- Regular performance reviews
- Adjust intervention based on progress
- Set timeline for improvement
- Document all actions and outcomes

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Assuming Motivation When It's Capability
- Symptom: Manager says "they just don't care"
- Reality: Employee doesn't know how to succeed
- Solution: Assess skills before addressing motivation

### Mistake 2: Assuming Capability When It's Motivation
- Symptom: Training doesn't improve performance
- Reality: Employee knows how but won't apply effort
- Solution: Address motivation and barriers

### Mistake 3: Mixed Interventions
- Symptom: Providing both training and motivation simultaneously
- Reality: Confusing and ineffective
- Solution: Diagnose first, then apply focused intervention
