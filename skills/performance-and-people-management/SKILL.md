# Performance and People Management

## When to Use This Skill
- Managing underperforming employees
- Diagnosing root causes of performance issues
- Designing promotion and selection systems
- Implementing productivity improvements
- Applying manufacturing discipline to knowledge work

## Part 1: Employee Performance Diagnosis

### Identify the Problem
Observe that an employee is not performing their job duties effectively.

### Determine Root Cause
Categorize the issue into one of two buckets:

#### Can't Do It (Capability Issue)
- Employee lacks the necessary skills, knowledge, or ability
- Training or development is required
- May require role reassignment if capability cannot be developed

#### Won't Do It (Motivation Issue)
- Employee has the capability but lacks the drive or willingness
- Motivation, incentives, or consequences are required
- May require addressing underlying personal or environmental factors

### Select Intervention

**If Can't Do**: Train the employee
- Provide skill development
- Offer mentoring or coaching
- Consider job redesign if capability gap is fundamental

**If Won't Do**: Motivate the employee
- Clarify expectations and consequences
- Provide incentives and recognition
- Address personal or environmental barriers
- Consider performance improvement plans

### Critical Constraint
There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train.

## Part 2: Output-Oriented Management Approach

### Core Principle
All employees in an organization "produce" in some sense, whether making physical products, preparing bills, creating software designs, or writing advertising copy.

### Apply Manufacturing Discipline
1. Apply the principles and discipline of the most output-oriented endeavors—manufacturing—to all forms of business enterprise
2. Use this production-oriented approach to manage the work of managers themselves, not just production lines
3. Utilize this systematic method to manage any work type, similar to how finance provides a common language for investments

### Example Production Role Categorization
Based on Intel model:
- **25%** make the products
- **25%** support production (supervise, maintain, engineer)
- **25%** work in administration (schedule, bill, pay)
- **25%** design, sell, and service products

### Key Insight
Every role can be viewed through a production lens with defined inputs, processes, and outputs.

## Part 3: The Peter Principle

### Understand the Principle
"In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

### Analyze the Selection Process
1. **Selection criteria**: The selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role
2. **Missing criteria**: This selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"
3. **Trajectory**: Because promotion is based on current success, the employee continues to be promoted until they reach a role they are not skilled for
4. **Outcome**: The employee stops being promoted once they are no longer competent

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Assess intended role abilities**: Evaluate candidates based on skills required for the new position, not just current performance
2. **Use competency frameworks**: Define specific competencies for each role level
3. **Trial periods**: Test candidates in the new role before permanent promotion
4. **Development pathways**: Provide training for new role requirements before promotion
5. **Alternative progression**: Create lateral growth opportunities that don't require management

## Execution Steps

### For Performance Issues:
1. Observe and document specific performance gaps
2. Determine if issue is capability (can't) or motivation (won't)
3. Select appropriate intervention (train or motivate)
4. Monitor progress and adjust approach
5. Set clear timelines for improvement

### For Productivity Improvement:
1. Define the "production" output for each role
2. Identify inputs, processes, and quality metrics
3. Apply manufacturing discipline (standardization, measurement, continuous improvement)
4. Measure output and identify bottlenecks
5. Implement process improvements

### For Promotion Decisions:
1. Define competencies required for the new role
2. Assess candidate against new role requirements, not current performance
3. Provide development opportunities for skill gaps
4. Consider trial periods or acting roles
5. Create alternative career paths for individual contributors

## Constraints

- Performance diagnosis: Assumes role and expectations are clearly defined
- Output-oriented approach: Does not apply if work cannot be defined as "production" of any sort
- Peter Principle: Does not apply if selection is based on competencies specific to the intended role

## Result

Accurate diagnosis and intervention for performance issues, systematic productivity improvements through production-oriented management, and promotion systems that place people in roles where they can succeed rather than reach their level of incompetence.
