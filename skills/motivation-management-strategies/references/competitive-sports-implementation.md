# Competitive Sports Approach: Detailed Implementation

## Establishing the Racetrack

**Example: Building Maintenance Czar**
- Assign a "building czar" to score facility maintenance
- Compare scores across buildings
- Creates immediate improvement without monetary rewards
- Employees self-motivate to beat peers

**Key Elements:**
- Clear, visible scoring system
- Regular comparison cycles (weekly/monthly)
- Public display of rankings
- Objective metrics where possible

## The Coach Persona

**Behaviors to Adopt:**
- Give credit to team, take blame yourself
- Provide critical, specific feedback
- Push for "personal best" not just "good enough"
- Focus on skill development, not office politics

**Behaviors to Avoid:**
- Taking credit for team successes
- Being "nice" at expense of performance
- Focusing on perks (office size, title) instead of output
- Protecting team from necessary criticism

## Fear Management

**Positive Fear of Failure:**
- Spurs preparation and effort
- Creates urgency and focus
- Drives continuous improvement

**Negative Fear of Failure:**
- Causes conservative risk-avoidance
- Leads to hiding problems
- Paralyzes decision-making

**Normalization Techniques:**
- Frame failure as learning opportunity
- Use sports analogies ("even the best teams lose 50% of matches")
- Celebrate effort and learning, not just success
- Analyze failures publicly without blame

## Maintaining Competition

**Warning Signs of Declining Competition:**
- Mergers or reorganizations that eliminate comparison points
- "Everyone gets a trophy" mentality
- Removal of public metrics
- Shift to subjective evaluations

**Sustainability Factors:**
- Rotate competitive elements to prevent boredom
- Ensure fairness in scoring
- Allow for different "leagues" based on capability
- Keep rules stable and transparent
