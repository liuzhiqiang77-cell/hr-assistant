# Peak Performance - Detailed Reference

## Self-Actualization Driver Types

### Competence-Driven
- **Focus**: Mastery of specific job or task
- **Behavior Pattern**:
  - Deliberate practice
  - Continuous skill refinement
  - Personal benchmarking
- **Examples**:
  - Musician practicing scales daily
  - Athlete refining technique
  - Programmer optimizing code
- **Management Approach**: Provide opportunities for skill development and mastery challenges

### Achievement-Driven
- **Focus**: Abstract achievement across all endeavors
- **Behavior Pattern**:
  - Testing limits of capability
  - Working at boundary of ability
  - Seeking challenges regardless of domain
- **Risk Profile Classification** (based on peg/ring experiment):
  - **Gamblers**: High risk, no influence on outcome
  - **Conservatives**: Very little risk, avoid failure
  - **Achievers**: Moderate risk, challenge at boundary of capability
- **Management Approach**: Provide stretch goals with meaningful stakes

## MBO Goal Setting Guidelines

### Optimal Difficulty
- Target: 50% success probability
- Too easy: No motivation, boredom
- Too hard: Demotivation, learned helplessness
- Just right: Maximum effort and growth

### Why 50% Works
- Forces maximum effort
- Creates meaningful challenge
- Builds resilience through occasional failure
- Prevents complacency from guaranteed success

## Competitive Environment Design

### Essential Elements
1. **Clear Rules**: Everyone understands how to win
2. **Visible Metrics**: Scores or rankings are transparent
3. **Peer Comparison**: Employees can measure against others
4. **Continuous Play**: Competition is ongoing, not one-time

### Example: Building Maintenance Competition
- Assign "building czar" to score each facility
- Compare scores across buildings monthly
- Post rankings publicly
- No monetary rewards needed—competition itself motivates

### Risks to Monitor
- Destructive competition (sabotage, withholding information)
- Burnout from constant pressure
- Short-term optimization at expense of long-term health
- Loss of collaboration

## Culture Types

### Knowledge-Centered Culture
- **Values**: Abstract knowledge, credentials, knowing
- **Problem**: Low actual achievement, talking over doing
- **Example**: Academic environments where publication matters more than impact

### Output-Centered Culture
- **Values**: Tangible results, measurable impact, delivery
- **Benefit**: High achievement, results focus
- **Example**: Startup culture where shipping product matters most

## Fear Management

### Positive Fear of Failure
- Spurs preparation and effort
- Creates urgency and focus
- Drives improvement

### Negative Fear of Failure
- Causes conservative risk-avoidance
- Leads to hiding problems
- Results in innovation paralysis

### Manager's Role
- Normalize failure as statistical probability
- Distinguish between failure from effort vs. failure from negligence
- Celebrate learning from failures
- Maintain psychological safety while maintaining standards
