# 'Blast' Process Dialogue Examples

## Example 1: Successful Progression Through All Stages

**Manager**: "John, I need to discuss your performance over the last quarter. Your sales numbers are 40% below target."

**John (Stage 1 - Ignore)**: "I've been really busy with other projects."

**Manager**: "Let me show you the data. You had 20 qualified leads and closed only 2. The team average is 8 closures from 20 leads. Here are the specific call logs and follow-up records." [Shows facts and examples]

**John (Stage 2 - Deny)**: "Those leads weren't really qualified. The market is terrible right now."

**Manager**: "I've reviewed the lead qualification criteria. All 20 met the standard. Also, the market grew 5% this quarter while your performance declined. Here's the market research data." [Uses evidence]

**John (Stage 3 - Blame Others)**: "Marketing is sending me bad leads. And the product team hasn't fixed the bugs customers complain about."

**Manager**: "I understand those challenges exist. However, other reps with the same leads and same product are hitting their targets. Let's focus on what you can control. What could you do differently?"

**John (Stage 4 - Assume Responsibility)**: "I guess... I haven't been following up as consistently as I should. And I'm not preparing well for the calls."

**Manager**: "That's a good start. If it's your responsibility to improve, what specifically will you do?"

**John (Stage 5 - Find Solution)**: "I'll create a follow-up schedule and stick to it. I'll spend 30 minutes preparing for each call. I'll ask Sarah to role-play with me twice a week."

**Manager**: "That sounds like a solid plan. Let's review progress in two weeks."

## Example 2: Fallback Procedure at 'Blame Others'

**Manager**: "Maria, your project is 3 months behind schedule and over budget by 50%."

**Maria (Stage 3 - Blame Others)**: "It's not my fault. Engineering keeps changing requirements. IT won't give me the resources I need. The stakeholders keep moving the goalposts."

**Manager**: "I understand you're facing challenges. However, other project managers with similar constraints are delivering on time."

**Maria**: "You don't understand my situation. It's impossible to succeed with these constraints."

**Manager**: [Switching to formal supervisor role] "Maria, I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right. However, I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions."

**Maria**: "What do you want me to do?"

**Manager**: "This is what I want you to do:
1. Submit a detailed recovery plan by Friday at 5 PM
2. Hold daily stand-up meetings with your team
3. Provide weekly status reports to me
4. Reduce scope to deliver the critical path items first

Do you commit to this course of action?"

**Maria**: "I still think it's unfair, but I'll do it."

**Manager**: "Thank you. I'll monitor your performance against this commitment. Let's meet next Monday to review your recovery plan."

## Example 3: High Achiever Development

**Manager**: "Lisa, your performance this year has been exceptional. You exceeded your targets by 30% and led two major initiatives."

**Lisa**: "Thank you! I worked really hard."

**Manager**: "I want to make sure we're not just celebrating past success. Looking ahead, what are your goals for next year?"

**Lisa**: "I'm not sure. Just keep doing what I'm doing, I guess."

**Manager**: "Let me be more specific. Based on your performance, you're ready for the next level. To get there, I'd like you to:

1. **Mentor two junior team members** - Document your approach and teach them your methods
2. **Lead a cross-functional initiative** - The supply chain optimization project needs a leader
3. **Develop strategic thinking skills** - Attend the advanced strategy course and present a market analysis to the executive team

These are stretch goals that will prepare you for a senior role. What do you think?"

**Lisa**: "That's ambitious. I'm excited about the cross-functional project. The mentoring will be new for me."

**Manager**: "Great. Let's set up monthly check-ins to track your progress on these goals. This is about your growth, not just hitting numbers."
