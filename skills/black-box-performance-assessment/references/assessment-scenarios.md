# Sample Assessment Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Sales Manager in Growth Mode
**Output Measures (60% weighting)**:
- Quota attainment: 85%
- New client acquisition: 12 (target: 10)
- Revenue growth: 8% (target: 5%)

**Internal Measures (40% weighting)**:
- Trained 2 junior reps now hitting quota
- Implemented new CRM process improving team efficiency
- High team engagement scores

**Assessment**: Output slightly below target, but exceptional internal contribution. Given growth phase emphasis on capability building: "Exceeds Expectations."

## Scenario 2: Engineering Lead in Crisis Mode
**Output Measures (90% weighting)**:
- Critical bug fix completed: Yes
- System uptime: 99.9% (target: 99.5%)
- Feature delivery: 2 of 4 (target: 4)

**Internal Measures (10% weighting)**:
- Team morale strained due to long hours
- Documentation behind schedule

**Assessment**: Output measures are exceptional given crisis; internal measures temporarily deprioritized. Overall: "Meets Expectations" with note to address team recovery post-crisis.

# Output vs Internal Measure Examples by Role

| Role | Output Measures | Internal Measures |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Sales | Revenue, quota attainment, deals closed | Pipeline building, training juniors, market intelligence |
| Engineering | Features shipped, bugs fixed, uptime | Code quality, mentoring, technical debt reduction |
| Marketing | Leads generated, campaign ROI, conversion | Brand building, market research, channel development |
| HR | Open roles filled, retention rate, time-to-hire | Culture initiatives, succession planning, employee development |

# The Trade-off Transparency Principle

When completing assessments, explicitly state:
1. The weighting used for this period
2. Why that weighting was chosen
3. Which measures were traded off against which
4. How this assessment compares to previous periods

This ensures fairness and helps subordinates understand what to prioritize going forward.
