name: black-box-performance-assessment
description: Assess subordinate performance using the Black Box methodology, which evaluates both tangible output and internal measures. Apply this during performance reviews, when evaluating team members, or when determining how to weigh different types of contributions. Use this framework to balance immediate results against activities that build future capability, making explicit trade-offs clear.

# Black Box Performance Assessment

## Core Concept

Treat performance assessment as evaluating a "black box" where:
- **Output measures** = What comes out of the box (tangible results)
- **Internal measures** = What happens inside the box (activities creating current and future output)

## Apply This Skill When

- Conducting performance reviews or assessments
- Evaluating employee contributions
- Determining bonuses, promotions, or development plans
- Weighing different types of work (immediate vs. long-term)
- Providing comprehensive performance feedback

## Execution Framework

### 1. Define Expectations Upfront

Before assessment begins:
- Clarify in advance what is expected from the subordinate
- Establish clear standards for both output and internal measures
- Communicate how different contributions will be weighted

**Critical:** Assessment must be against pre-defined standards, not arbitrary or retroactive criteria.

### 2. Evaluate Output Measures

Assess tangible results that can be plotted on charts:

**Examples:**
- Designs completed
- Sales quotas met or exceeded
- Production yield improvements
- Projects delivered on time/budget
- Bugs fixed, features shipped
- Revenue generated
- Customer satisfaction scores

**Characteristics:**
- Objective and measurable
- Time-bound (within the review period)
- Direct contribution to organizational goals
- Easy to communicate to stakeholders

### 3. Evaluate Internal Measures

Assess activities that:

**Create Output for Current Period:**
- Collaboration that enabled team success
- Problem-solving that unblocked others
- Knowledge shared that improved team capability
- Process improvements implemented

**Set Stage for Future Output:**
- Mentoring and developing other team members
- Building team cohesion and culture
- Establishing systems that prevent future problems
- Strategic planning and positioning
- Ensuring department health to prevent future disgruntlement

**Characteristics:**
- Often qualitative and harder to measure
- May not show immediate tangible results
- Critical for long-term organizational health
- Subjective but observable through behavior

### 4. Determine Weighting

There is no strict formula—weighting is **situational** and can shift monthly:

| **Context** | **Typical Weighting** | **Rationale** |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Crisis/Immediate delivery needed | 90% Output / 10% Internal | Results matter most |
| Building new team capability | 50% Output / 50% Internal | Future critical |
| Senior leadership role | 30% Output / 70% Internal | Legacy and team building |
| Individual contributor | 80% Output / 20% Internal | Deliverables primary |
| Turnaround situation | 70% Output / 30% Internal | Quick wins needed |

**Factors influencing weighting:**
- Organizational stage (startup vs. established)
- Role level and responsibilities
- Team maturity
- Business priorities
- Time horizon (quarter vs. year)

### 5. Conduct Trade-off Analysis

Make the assessment explicit by identifying:

**What is being traded:**
- Current output vs. future capability
- Individual contribution vs. team enablement
- Short-term results vs. long-term systems

**Why this weighting makes sense:**
- Link to organizational priorities
- Explain the context that informed the decision
- Connect to business objectives

**Document the rationale:**
- Ensure the employee understands how they were evaluated
- Create a record for future assessments
- Enable consistent application over time

## Constraints

- Difficult to apply strictly objectively to professional work
- Internal measures rely on observational judgment
- Weighting must be transparent to be perceived as fair
- Expectations must be defined before assessment period begins

## Result Template

"A balanced performance score of [X]/[Y] based on weighted output and internal measures, with explicit documentation of trade-offs between immediate results and future capability building."
