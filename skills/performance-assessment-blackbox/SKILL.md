# Performance Assessment: Black Box Methodology

## When to Use
- Conducting performance reviews or assessments
- Evaluating a subordinate's overall contribution
- Need to balance immediate results with long-term capability building
- Making decisions about promotions, compensation, or development

## Assessment Framework

### Step 1: Define Expectations
- Clarify in advance what is expected from the subordinate
- Ensure assessment against clear standards (not subjective impressions)
- Document expectations before the observation period begins

### Step 2: Evaluate Output Measures (Output of the Black Box)
Assess tangible results that can be plotted on charts:
- Completing designs
- Meeting sales quotas
- Increasing production yield
- Delivering projects on time/budget
- Any quantifiable, measurable achievements

### Step 3: Evaluate Internal Measures (Inside the Black Box)
Assess activities that contribute to current and future capability:

**Current Period Activities:**
- Activities creating output for the current period

**Future-Focused Activities:**
- Positioning/developing people
- Ensuring department health to prevent future disgruntlement
- Building processes and systems for sustainability
- Mentoring and knowledge transfer
- Strategic thinking and planning

### Step 4: Determine Weighting
- **No strict formula** exists for comparing significance
- Weighting is situational and context-dependent:
  - Example: 50/50 balance
  - Example: 90/10 favoring output (crunch time)
  - Example: 10/90 favoring internal (turnaround phase)
- Weighting can shift monthly or per assessment period

### Step 5: Trade-off Analysis
- Explicitly identify which variables are being traded off against each other
- Document the reasoning for the chosen weighting
- Ensure trade-offs are communicated clearly to the subordinate

## Variables
- **output_measures**: Tangible results produced during the review period (quantitative/tangible)
- **internal_measures**: Activities contributing to current output and future capability (qualitative/intangible)

## Key Constraints
- Difficult to apply strictly objectively to professional work
- Subjective judgment required for weighting decisions
- Must balance short-term results with long-term health
- Requires clear definition of expectations upfront
