# Adapting One-on-Ones for Electronic Communication

## Impact of Computer Networks and Email

Modern organizations have seen a dramatic increase in information availability through electronic means. This affects one-on-one meetings in several ways:

### What Changed

- **Employees are more informed:** Business developments are shared through computer networks
- **Less dependency on manager:** Subordinates no longer rely solely on managers for basic updates
- **Information velocity:** News travels faster without requiring face-to-face transmission

### How to Adapt

| Traditional Approach | Adapted Approach | Reason |
|---------------------|------------------|--------|
| Meet weekly regardless of span | Reduce frequency with more direct reports | Information already available electronically |
| Standard 1+ hour duration | Shorter durations acceptable | No need for lengthy status updates |
| General updates covered | Focus on specific problems/skills | General knowledge is self-service |
| Primary info channel | Supplemental coaching channel | Electronic channels handle transmission |

### Still Necessary, Just Different

One-on-one meetings remain "absolutely necessary" but their scope has narrowed:

**Keep doing:**
- Mutual education
- Exchange of information on specific problems
- Teaching skills and know-how
- Coaching on approach
- Addressing concerns and frustrations

**Shift to electronic:**
- General business updates
- Routine status reporting
- Information already available in documents/emails

### Practical Guidelines

**Span of control 5-6:**
- Traditional frequency (weekly for low TRM, bi-weekly for medium, monthly for high)
- Standard 1-hour duration

**Span of control 8-10+:**
- Reduced frequency (extend intervals by 25-50%)
- Shorter duration (45-60 minutes max)
- Greater reliance on subordinate preparation

**Rate of Change Trumps Electronics:**
- Even with great electronic communication, high-change areas (marketing, tech) still need frequent meetings
- TRM remains the primary driver—electronics is a secondary adjustment factor
