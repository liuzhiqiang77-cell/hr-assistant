# Handling the "Zinger" in One-on-One Meetings

## What is a Zinger?
A sensitive or critical issue raised at the very end of a meeting, leaving insufficient time to address it properly.

## Common Examples
- "I'm thinking about quitting"
- "I have a serious ethical concern"
- "I'm dealing with a personal crisis affecting my work"

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Time Management
- Reserve the last 15-20 minutes specifically for "any other concerns"
- Explicitly ask: "Is there anything else we need to discuss before we wrap up?"

### 2. Observation
- Watch for body language suggesting withheld information
- Note if subordinate seems hesitant or distracted

### 3. Regular Check-ins
- Create psychological safety throughout the meeting
- Encourage openness from the start

## When a Zinger Occurs

### Immediate Response
1. **Acknowledge**: "This is important and deserves proper attention"
2. **Assess urgency**: "Does this need to be addressed right now, or can we schedule a dedicated session?"
3. **Take notes**: Document the issue immediately

### Follow-Up Options

**Option A: Extend Current Meeting**
- If time permits and issue is urgent
- Clear your schedule if necessary

**Option B: Schedule Dedicated Session**
- Set up a meeting within 24-48 hours
- Send confirmation of time and topic

**Option C: Immediate Escalation**
- For critical issues (legal, safety, ethical)
- Involve appropriate resources immediately
