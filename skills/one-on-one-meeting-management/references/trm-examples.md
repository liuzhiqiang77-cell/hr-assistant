# Task-Relevant Maturity Examples

## High TRM in One Area, Low in Another
- A senior engineer may have high TRM for technical design but low TRM for managing people
- A marketing manager may have high TRM for campaigns but low TRM for financial analysis

## Factors That Reduce TRM
- New environment or content
- Abrupt job changes
- Accelerated pace of work
- New technology or processes

## Dynamic Nature
TRM can change day by day or hour by hour based on circumstances.
