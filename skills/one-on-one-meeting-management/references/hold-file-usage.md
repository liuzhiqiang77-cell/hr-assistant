# Hold File Usage Guide

## Purpose

The Hold File is a batching mechanism to minimize ad hoc interruptions (phone calls, drop-ins) by accumulating non-urgent issues for scheduled discussion.

## How to Use

1. **Both parties maintain a Hold File**: Supervisor and subordinate each keep their own

2. **Add items throughout the week**: When a non-urgent issue arises, add it to the Hold File instead of interrupting

3. **Review during one-on-ones**: Go through Hold File items during the scheduled meeting

4. **Prioritize**: Not all Hold File items need to be addressed—focus on what's most important

## Benefits
