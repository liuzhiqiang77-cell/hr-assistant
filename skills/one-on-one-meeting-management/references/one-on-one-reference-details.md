# One-on-One Meeting Reference Details

## The "Zinger" Problem

A "Zinger" is a sensitive or critical issue raised at the very end of a one-on-one meeting, leaving insufficient time to address it properly.

### Common Zinger Examples
- "I'm thinking about quitting"
- "I have a serious conflict with a peer"
- "I'm not happy in this role"

### Prevention Strategies
- Reserve 10-15 minutes at the end for "anything else?"
- Explicitly ask: "Is there anything we haven't covered that's on your mind?"
- If a Zinger appears, acknowledge it and schedule a follow-up immediately

## Hold File Management

The Hold File is a batching mechanism to minimize interruptions.

### What Goes in the Hold File
- Important but non-urgent questions
- Issues that can wait until the next scheduled meeting
- Ideas or suggestions that don't require immediate action

### How to Use It
- Both manager and subordinate maintain their own Hold Files
- Review Hold File items at the start or end of each one-on-one
- Move resolved items to an archive
- Keep the file visible during the meeting
