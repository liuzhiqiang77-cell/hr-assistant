# Handling the "Zinger"

## What is a Zinger?

A "zinger" is a sensitive or critical issue raised at the very end of a one-on-one meeting, leaving insufficient time to address it properly.

## Common Zinger Examples

- "I'm thinking about quitting"
- "I have another job offer"
- "I'm really struggling with [major issue]"
- "I don't think I can work with [colleague] anymore"

## Why Zingers Happen

- Subordinate builds up courage throughout the meeting
- Fear of the topic causes procrastination
- Subordinate hopes the "right moment" will appear
- Lack of preparation or structure

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Set Expectations Early**: "Please bring up important topics early so we have time to discuss them properly"

2. **Review Agenda First**: Ask if there are any sensitive topics before diving into routine items

3. **Time Check**: With 15-20 minutes remaining, ask: "Is there anything else we need to cover, especially anything sensitive or time-consuming?"

4. **Create Psychological Safety**: Regularly encourage open dialogue so issues don't fester

## When a Zinger Occurs

1. **Acknowledge Immediately**: "This is important and deserves proper time."

2. **Don't Rush**: Do not try to resolve a major issue in 5 minutes

3. **Schedule Follow-Up**: "Let's meet tomorrow morning to discuss this properly."

4. **Document**: Note the issue and commit to a specific time

5. **Stay Calm**: Your reaction sets the tone for the conversation

6. **Prepare**: Before the follow-up, gather information and think through your response
