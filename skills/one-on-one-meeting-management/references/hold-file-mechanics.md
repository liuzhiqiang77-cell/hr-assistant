# Hold File Mechanics

## Purpose

The hold file applies the batching principle to minimize ad hoc interruptions:
- Phone calls
- Drop-in visits
- Unscheduled meetings

## How It Works

### During One-on-One

1. **Review hold file items** from previous meeting
2. **Discuss and resolve** items that have become urgent
3. **Keep non-urgent items** in hold file for future
4. **Add new non-urgent issues** that arise during discussion

### Between Meetings

**When an issue arises**:
1. Assess urgency: Can this wait until next one-on-one?
2. If yes: Add to hold file
3. If no: Handle immediately (true emergency)

**Benefits**:
- Reduces interruptions
- Encourages problem prioritization
- Creates dedicated time for issue resolution
- Builds discipline in issue management

## Managing the "Zinger"

### Definition

A "zinger" is a sensitive or critical issue raised at the very end of a meeting, leaving insufficient time to address it properly.

### Examples

- "I'm thinking about quitting"
- "I have a serious ethical concern"
- "I'm dealing with a personal crisis"

### Handling Strategy

1. **Acknowledge importance**: "This is critical and deserves proper time"
2. **Don't rush**: Do not try to resolve in remaining minutes
3. **Schedule dedicated time**: "Let's meet tomorrow morning to discuss this fully"
4. **Express support**: Show you take the issue seriously

### Prevention

- Check in early: "Any heart-to-heart topics to discuss today?"
- Reserve time: Keep 15-20 minutes buffer at end
- Create safety: Regularly encourage open discussion
