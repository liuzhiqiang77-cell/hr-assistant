# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) Detailed Assessment

## Definition

Task-Relevant Maturity is a combination of:
- The degree of the subordinate's achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience

## Key Characteristics

### Specificity
- TRM is very specific to the task at hand
- A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another

### Factors Causing Low TRM
- New environment, content, or tasks
- Accelerated pace of the job
- Abrupt changes in the job itself
- Even seasoned managers may have low TRM in new roles

### Dynamic Nature
- TRM can change day by day or hour by hour
- Not a static assessment

## Distinguishing from General Competence

Do not confuse a manager's general competence and maturity with their task-relevant maturity:
- High general maturity ≠ high TRM in a new role
- TRM is task-specific, not person-specific

## Output

Task-Relevant Maturity Level (Low, Medium/Growing, High) specific to the current task
