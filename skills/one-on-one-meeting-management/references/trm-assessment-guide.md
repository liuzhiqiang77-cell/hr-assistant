# Task-Relevant Maturity Assessment Guide

## Definition
Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) is a combination of:
- Degree of achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience

## Key Principles

### Specificity
TRM is very specific to the task at hand. A person can have:
- High TRM in one job
- Low TRM in another job

### Factors Causing Low TRM
Even seasoned managers may have low TRM when:
- The environment is new to them
- The content is unfamiliar
- The tasks are different
- The pace of the job accelerates
- The job itself abruptly changes

### Distinguish from General Competence
Do not confuse:
- General competence and maturity
- Task-relevant maturity

High general maturity does NOT guarantee high TRM in a new role.

## Dynamic Nature
TRM can change:
- Day by day
- Hour by hour

Always assess TRM in the context of the specific task and current situation.
