# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) Reference

## Definition
TRM is a combination of:
- Degree of achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience

## Key Characteristics
- **Task-specific**: A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another
- **Dynamic**: Can change day by day or hour by hour
- **Context-dependent**: Even seasoned managers may have low TRM in new environments

## Factors Causing Low TRM
- New environment, content, or tasks
- Accelerated pace of job
- Abrupt job changes

## Common Misconception
Do not confuse general competence/maturity with task-relevant maturity. High general maturity does not guarantee high TRM in a new role.
