# One-on-One Frequency Calculation Examples

## Base Formula

**Frequency = f(TRM, Rate of Change)**

Where:
- TRM: Task-Relevant Maturity (Low/Medium/High)
- Rate of Change: Environmental pace (Low/High)

## Decision Matrix

| TRM | Rate of Change | Frequency | Example |
|-----|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Low | High | Weekly | New marketing manager in fast-moving tech |
| Low | Low | Weekly | New research scientist in stable lab |
| Medium | High | Weekly | Growing product manager in startup |
| Medium | Low | Bi-weekly | Experienced engineer in mature manufacturing |
| High | High | Bi-weekly | Veteran sales lead in evolving market |
| High | Low | Monthly | Senior researcher in long-term R&D |

## Adaptation for Span of Control

### Traditional Span (5-7 reports)
- Weekly meetings for most
- 1 hour duration
- Full agenda coverage

### Large Span (10+ reports)
- Bi-weekly or monthly for experienced reports
- 30-45 minute duration
- Focused agenda (coaching, specific issues)
- Leverage electronic updates for status

## Adaptation for Electronic Communication

### Before Networks/Email
- Frequent meetings needed for information sharing
- Manager was primary information source

### After Networks/Email
- Employees informed via systems
- Meetings focus on:
  - Mutual education
  - Skill development
  - Specific problem-solving
  - Relationship building

### Time Savings

| Factor | Traditional | Adapted |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Frequency | Weekly | Bi-weekly/monthly |
| Duration | 60 minutes | 30-45 minutes |
| Purpose | Info + coaching | Coaching only |
