# Detailed One-on-One Meeting Reference

## Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) Assessment

TRM is task-specific, not general. A person can have high TRM in one job and low TRM in another. Even seasoned managers have low TRM when:
- Environment is new to them
- Content is unfamiliar
- Tasks are different from prior experience
- Pace of job accelerates
- Job itself abruptly changes

## Time Management Warning: The Zinger

A "Zinger" is a heart-to-heart issue raised at meeting's end, often involving:
- Resignation announcement
- Major personal issues affecting work
- Serious dissatisfaction
- Request for transfer

**Prevention:** With 15-20 minutes remaining, explicitly ask: "Is there anything else we should discuss before we wrap up?" This creates space for significant issues.
