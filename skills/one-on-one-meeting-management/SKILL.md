# One-on-One Meeting Management

## When to Use

- Scheduling recurring one-on-one meetings with subordinates
- Determining appropriate meeting frequency based on experience level
- Preparing for and conducting productive one-on-one sessions
- Adapting meeting practices for teams with electronic communication systems

## Determine Meeting Frequency

**Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)**
- TRM is the subordinate's experience with the specific task, NOT general experience or age
- Consider environment: High-change areas (e.g., marketing) need more frequent meetings than stable areas (e.g., research)

**Frequency Guidelines**
- **Low TRM / High Change**: Meet weekly or more frequently
- **High TRM / Low Change**: Meet every few weeks
- **With electronic communication (email/networks)**: Reduce frequency and duration compared to traditional settings
- **Large spans (10+ direct reports)**: Meet less often than with smaller teams

## Prepare for the Meeting

**Duration**
- Minimum 1 hour required
- Shorter meetings (15 min) limit discussion to simple topics; big problems need time

**Location**
- Meet in or near the subordinate's work area
- Enables observation of organization, document efficiency, and interruption patterns

**Subordinate Ownership**
- Meeting belongs to the subordinate
- Subordinate prepares an outline in advance
- Both parties take notes on the outline during meeting

**Scheduling**
- Use rolling basis: Schedule next meeting as current one ends
- Avoid fixed schedules (e.g., "every second Wednesday") which conflict with vacations

**Remote Meetings**
- Supervisor must receive outline before meeting starts
- Exchange notes after meeting to ensure clarity

## Conduct the Meeting

**Content Scope**
- Performance figures and indicators (especially trouble signals)
- Events since last meeting: hiring, people problems, organizational issues
- Future plans and potential problems (including intuitions)
- Issues that preoccupy the subordinate

**Supervisor Role**
- Facilitate and coach; learn from the subordinate
- Apply Grove's Principle of Didactic Management: "Ask one more question!"
- Keep digging until root causes emerge

**Mechanical Hints**
- **Note-taking**: Both parties take notes on the outline
  - Keeps focus, aids digestion, forces logical categorization
  - Writing implies commitment to action
- **Hold File**: Accumulate important but non-urgent issues
  - Applies batching to minimize ad hoc interruptions

**Handle Heart-to-Heart Issues**
- Encourage deep work-related discussions (satisfaction, frustration, doubts)
- **Watch for "Zingers"**: Major issues raised near the end with no time to resolve

## Adapt for Modern Contexts

**When Electronic Communication Exists**
- Employees are already informed via networks
- Reduce meeting frequency and duration
- Focus meetings on mutual education and specific problems
- Avoid using meetings for general status updates

**Large Span of Control**
- Do not attempt same frequency with 10 reports as with 5
- Shorter meetings are acceptable when information flows electronically
- Retain meetings for coaching and specific issue resolution
