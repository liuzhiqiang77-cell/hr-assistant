# Performance Indicators and Monitoring

This skill provides methods for designing effective performance metrics and monitoring operations to enable proactive management.

## Design Effective Indicators

### Core Principles

1. **Attention Principle**: Indicators direct attention like steering a bicycle—you steer where you look
2. **Guard Against Overreaction**: Single metrics can lead to extreme behaviors
3. **Implement Paired Indicators**: Always pair effect and counter-effect to maintain optimum middle ground

**Paired Indicator Examples**:
- Inventory Levels ↔ Incidence of Shortages
- Completion Date ↔ Capability
- Vouchers Processed ↔ Errors Found
- Square Feet Cleaned ↔ Quality Rating

### Administrative Indicator Criteria

1. **Any measurement is better than none**
2. **Measure Output (results), not Activity (effort)**
   - Measure: Orders obtained, not calls made
3. **Measure Physical/Countable things**
   - Examples: Vouchers processed, transactions processed, people hired

## Monitor Daily Operations

Review this indicator set daily when starting operations:

1. **Sales Forecast**: Number of units planned for delivery today
2. **Variance**: Yesterday's actual vs. planned deliveries (assesses forecast confidence)
3. **Raw Material Inventory**: Stock levels of essential items
   - Too low: Order more supplies immediately
   - Too high: Cancel scheduled deliveries
4. **Equipment Condition**: Any breakdowns yesterday?
   - If yes: Arrange repairs or rearrange production line
5. **Manpower**: Staff availability vs. requirements
   - If understaffed: Call temporary help or reallocate staff
6. **Quality Indicator**: Customer complaint log
   - If complaints high: Address with staff immediately

## Track Linearity

Use linearity indicators for early warning on deadline goals:

1. **Plot Actual Output**: Achieved results vs. time elapsed
2. **Define Ideal Straight Line**: Linear trajectory from start to target
3. **Compare Progress**:
   - Below line: Calculate required rate for remaining period
   - Back-loaded (end of month): Identify inefficiency in resource use
4. **Take Action**: Corrective action before deadline passes

## Use Stagger Charts for Forecasting

Track forecast accuracy and business trends:

1. **Create Matrix**: Rows = forecast month, Columns = future months being forecasted
2. **Update Monthly**: Add new row each month with updated forecasts
3. **Analyze Variations**: Compare forecasts for same target month made at different times
4. **Interpret**: Significant variation indicates changing business trends
5. **Benefit**: Shows evolution of expectations, more valuable than simple trend charts
