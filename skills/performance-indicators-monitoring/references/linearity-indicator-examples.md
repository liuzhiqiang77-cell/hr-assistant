# Linearity Indicator Examples

## Recruiting Campaign

**Target**: 100 acceptances by June

**Data**:
- March: 15 acceptances
- April: 25 acceptances
- May: (projected)

**Analysis**:
- Ideal straight line: ~16-17 per month
- April actual (25) + March (15) = 40 total
- On pace for 80 total by June
- **Indicator**: Rate must increase from current 12/month to 30/month for remaining two months

## Manufacturing Production

**Target**: 1,000 units per month

**Pattern**: 200 units in weeks 1-3, 400 units in week 4

**Analysis**:
- Ideal: 250 units per week
- Actual: Early weeks underutilized, week 4 overloaded
- **Risk**: Equipment breakdown in week 4 causes missed goal
- **Action**: Reallocate resources to spread production evenly across month

## Administrative Processing

**Target**: 500 vouchers processed by month-end

**Progress by Day 20**:
- Ideal: ~333 vouchers processed (20/30 × 500)
- Actual: 250 vouchers processed
- **Indicator**: 125 vouchers behind schedule
- **Required Rate**: 250 vouchers in remaining 10 days = 25/day vs. 16.7/day ideal
