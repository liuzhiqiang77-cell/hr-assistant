# Subordinate Retention Procedure

## When to Use

- Valued, dedicated subordinate announces resignation
- Subordinate feels work is unappreciated
- Resignation is NOT solely motivated by money or perks at another company
- Employee is considered "valued" and "dedicated" to the organization

## When NOT to Use

- Employee is purely motivated by better financial offers elsewhere
- Employee is not considered "valued" or "dedicated"
- Employee has fundamental cultural mismatch with organization

## Phase 1: The Opening Skirmish (Immediate Reaction)

**Drop Everything Immediately**
- Sit the subordinate down right away
- Ask why they are quitting

**Listen Fully**
- Let them talk completely
- Do not argue, lecture, or panic
- Allow them to deliver rehearsed points

**Dig Deeper**
- Ask more questions to uncover real issues
- Convey through actions that they are important to you

**Buy Time**
- Do not try to change their mind yet
- Focus on understanding and preparing for the next round

## Phase 2: Supervisor Involvement

**Engage Your Supervisor**
- Go to your supervisor for help and advice
- Make the resignation your supervisor's problem
- Ensure they participate in the solution

## Phase 3: Corporate Citizenship & Solution Pursuit

**Pursue Every Avenue**
- Vigorously pursue ways to keep the employee with the firm
- Consider transferring to another department if necessary
- Become the project manager of the solution until settled

**The Golden Rule**
- You owe it to the employer to save an employee for the company
- Principle of reciprocity among managers

## Phase 4: Presenting the Solution

**Address Real Reasons**
- Return with a solution that addresses underlying issues
- Ensure solution benefits the company

**Alleviate Blackmailer Fears**
- Reframe the situation to counter fear of being viewed as "blackmailer"
- Quote: "You did not blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways."

## Phase 5: Countering External Offers

**Make Them "Quit Again"**
- If subordinate has accepted another job, get them to renounce it
- They have made two commitments:
  1. To a vague potential employer
  2. To you and their current team

**Emphasize Commitment Strength**
- Commitments to daily colleagues are stronger than to a "casual new acquaintance"
- Strengthen the bond to current team and organization

## Desired Outcome

- Subordinate retains employment with the company (potentially in new role/department)
- Successfully withdraws external resignation
- Strengthened relationship and increased engagement
