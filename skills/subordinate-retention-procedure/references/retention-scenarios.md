# Retention Scenarios and Examples

## When NOT to Use This Procedure
- Employee received 50% salary increase and that's the only reason
- Employee is moving to be closer to family (personal reasons)
- Employee has been underperforming despite coaching
- Employee is actively toxic to team culture

## Sample Opening Conversation

**Manager:** "John, I understand you're resigning. Before we go any further, I need to understand why. Can you tell me what's going on?"

**John:** (Gives rehearsed reasons about wanting new challenges)

**Manager:** "I hear you on the challenges. But is there something else? Have you been feeling undervalued or that your work hasn't been recognized?"

**John:** "Well, honestly, I put in 80-hour weeks on Project X and nobody said a word..."

## Sample Reframing for External Offer

**Manager:** "I know you've accepted an offer at Acme Corp. But think about this—you've committed to people who rely on you every day. The Acme recruiter is a stranger. Your team here knows your character and work. Which commitment is more real?"

## Solution Options to Consider
- Role expansion with new responsibilities
