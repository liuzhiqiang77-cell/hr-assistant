# Retention Conversation Scripts

## Step 1: Initial Conversation

### Opening
"I received your resignation. Before we discuss next steps, I want to understand what's led to this decision. Can you tell me what's going on?"

### During Their Explanation
- "I see. Go on."
- "That's important. Tell me more about that."
- "What else?"
- "How long has this been going on?"

### Uncovering Real Issues
"I appreciate you sharing that. Is there anything else—maybe something you haven't mentioned—that's contributing to this decision?"

### Closing Initial Conversation
"Thank you for being honest with me. This is important, and I need some time to think about what you've shared. Can we meet again [tomorrow/Day X] to continue this discussion?"

## Step 4: Presenting the Solution

### If Offering a Transfer
"We've been looking at this from every angle, and we think there's an opportunity in [Department] that would address the concerns you've raised. The role would involve [brief description], and we believe your skills would be a great fit."

### Reframing (The "Blackmailer" Concern)
"I know you might worry that this looks like you forced our hand. Let me be clear: you didn't blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways. This is the right thing for the organization, and we're grateful you brought it to our attention."

## Step 5: Countering External Offers

### The Commitment Argument
"I understand you've accepted another offer. But I want you to think about the commitments you've made. You've made a commitment to a potential employer—someone you've just met, who doesn't really know you yet. But you've also made commitments to the people you work with every day—your team, your colleagues, me. Those commitments are real and tested. Which commitment means more to you?"

### The "Quit Again" Close
"If you stay, you'll need to let that other employer know you won't be joining them. That means quitting—again. Are you ready to do that?"

## Common Objections and Responses

### "I've already given my word."
"I understand that feels important. But your word to your current team—the people who rely on you every day—matters more. A commitment to strangers shouldn't outweigh a commitment to friends and colleagues."

### "It's too late, they're expecting me."
"They'll find someone else. They're a business; they understand these things happen. But your team here—can they replace you as easily? And do you want to leave them in the lurch?"

### "I'm worried about how this looks."
"It looks like someone who was willing to leave, realized they were valued, and chose to stay where they have real relationships. That's not a bad look. That's loyalty."

### "What if things don't change?"
"Then we address it. But we can't address it if you're gone. Stay, and let's make this work together. If it doesn't work, you can always leave later. But give us—and yourself—a chance to make it right first."
