# Managerial Influence and Delegation

## When to Use
- Shaping organizational decisions or culture
- Influencing subordinate behavior without formal commands
- Delegating tasks to free up time
- Establishing leadership presence
- Allocating limited time resources

## Influence Mechanisms

### 1. Information Base (Foundation)
Information-gathering is the "basis of all other managerial work."

### 2. Conveying Information and Values
- Transmit objectives, priorities, and preferences
- Enable subordinates to make acceptable decisions (successful delegation)
- Foster "shared corporate culture" so "intelligent corporate citizens" behave consistently without formal rules

### 3. Decision-Making
**Direct Decisions**: Occasional explicit choices

**Participatory Decisions**: Provide inputs, opinions, debate, review, ratify, or veto

**Decision Types**:
- **Forward-looking**: Capital authorization (allocating financial resources)
- **Reactive**: Responding to technical crises or people issues

### 4. Nudging
**Definition**: Influencing events slightly without issuing "instruction or a command." Stronger than conveying info, weaker than a decision.

**Methods**:
- Phone calls suggesting direction
- Notes/memos showing perspective
- Comments during presentations

**Frequency**: Occurs "a dozen times" for every unambiguous decision

### 5. Role Modeling (Leadership)
**Principle**: "Nothing leads as well as example." Values conveyed by "doing and doing visibly."

**Scope**: Influences subordinates, peers, and supervisors

**Styles**: Large group/open or one-on-one/quiet (must be conscious and visible)

## Time Allocation

**Critical Resource**: While money/manpower/capital can be increased, "own time is the one absolutely finite resource."

**Priority**: Time allocation is the "single most important aspect of being a role model."

## Medium Selection

View meetings as a "medium," not an activity. Choose the medium (meeting, memo, loudspeaker) that provides the "greatest leverage" for the specific activity.

## Delegation Strategy

### Prerequisite Check
Ensure delegator and delegatee share a **common information base** and operational ideas. Without this, delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage.

### Avoid Insincere Delegation
Do not emotionally hold onto tasks while pretending to delegate (the "pencil experiment"). If you keep a task because you enjoy it, make it a conscious decision.

### Task Selection Rule
When given a choice, delegate activities that are **familiar to you** rather than unfamiliar ones.

**Reasoning**: Easier to monitor tasks you know best.

### Responsibility Principle
"Delegation without follow-through is abdication." You never wash your hands of the task; you remain responsible for its accomplishment.

## Execution Steps

### For Influence:
1. **Establish Information Base**: Gather necessary information
2. **Convey Values**: Transmit objectives and priorities
3. **Select Influence Mechanism**: Choose decision-making, nudging, or role modeling based on situation
4. **Allocate Time**: Prioritize time as a finite resource
5. **Choose Optimal Medium**: Select meeting, memo, or other medium for greatest leverage

### For Delegation:
1. **Check Common Information Base**: Ensure shared understanding
2. **Select Familiar Tasks**: Choose tasks you know well for easier monitoring
3. **Delegate Clearly**: Communicate expectations and outcomes
4. **Follow Through**: Monitor progress and remain responsible
5. **Avoid Insincerity**: Be honest about what you're delegating vs. keeping

## Key Variables
- `decision_type`: Forward-looking (capital) or Reactive (crisis)
- `influence_intensity`: Scale from conveying information to Nudging to Decision-Making
- `Common Information Base`: Shared understanding between manager and subordinate
- `Task Familiarity`: How well manager knows the specific task

## Important Notes
- Formal rules are inefficient substitutes for culture
- Nudging is more frequent than explicit decision-making
- Role modeling must be visible and conscious
- Time is the only absolutely finite managerial resource
- Delegation requires follow-through, not abandonment
