# Performance Diagnosis and Turnaround

## When to Use
- Observing poor performance or failure to do the job
- Subordinate at risk of termination unless performance improves
- Need to determine root cause before selecting intervention

## Diagnosing Performance Failure

### The "Life or Death" Diagnostic Test
Apply this test to determine why a person is not doing their job:

**Question**: "If this person's life depended on doing the work, could they do it?"

**Answer Analysis**:
- **YES** → Person is capable but NOT motivated → They **won't do it**
  - **Intervention**: Motivation strategies
- **NO** → Person is NOT capable → They **can't do it**
  - **Intervention**: Training

**Critical Principle**: These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job. Everything else is useless without addressing these root causes.

### Constraints
- Does not apply if root cause is external (e.g., equipment failure)
- Diagnosis must precede intervention

## The 'Blast' Turnaround Process

### Resistance Cycle Stages
Track the subordinate's progression through these stages:
1. **Ignore** - Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny** - Active denial of problem's existence
3. **Blame Others** - Admits problem exists but blames others
4. **Assume Responsibility** - Admits "It is my problem"
5. **Find Solution** - Intellectual step to remedy situation

### Facilitating Progression

**Stage 1 → Stage 2 (Ignore to Deny)**:
- Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality

**Stage 2 → Stage 3 (Deny to Blame)**:
- Use evidence to overcome resistance

**Stage 3 → Stage 4 (Blame to Responsibility)** - **The Critical Step**:
- This is an **emotional step** (hard)
- Guide subordinate to realize: "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
- This implies work and unpleasantness

**Stage 4 → Stage 5 (Responsibility to Solution)**:
- This is an **intellectual step** (easier)
- Finding solution becomes a shared task

### Possible Outcomes
1. Subordinate accepts assessment AND recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment BUT accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment AND does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (Stuck at "Blame Others")
If subordinate refuses to assume responsibility:

1. Assume formal supervisor role with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do"
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right"
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am empowered and required by the organization to give you instructions. This is what I want you to do"
5. Secure subordinate's commitment
6. Monitor performance against commitment

### Process Constraint
Cannot proceed to solution-finding if subordinate is stuck in denial or blame stages.

## Execution Steps
1. **Identify performance issue** - Person is not doing their job
2. **Apply "Life or Death" test** - Could they do it if their life depended on it?
3. **Diagnose root cause** - Capability (can't) or Motivation (won't)
4. **Select intervention** - Training or Motivation strategies
5. **If turnaround needed**: Track resistance cycle stage
6. **Facilitate progression** through stages using facts and evidence
7. **Use fallback procedure** if stuck at "Blame Others"
