# 'Blast' Process Dialogue Examples

## Example 1: Moving from Blame Others to Assume Responsibility

**Manager**: "I've reviewed the project delays. The deadline was missed by three weeks."

**Subordinate (Stage 3 - Blame Others)**: "That's not my fault. Marketing didn't give me the requirements until two weeks before the deadline. And engineering kept changing the specs."

**Manager**: "I understand those challenges happened. But let's look at your role. When Marketing was late, did you escalate? Did you get a commitment on frozen specs from engineering?"

**Subordinate**: "Well, I sent some emails..."

**Manager**: "Let me show you the timeline. On June 1st, you knew Marketing was delayed. You didn't escalate to me until June 20th. That's 19 days. During that time, what did you do to mitigate the risk?"

**Subordinate**: "I... I guess I didn't do enough. I kept hoping it would work out."

**Manager**: "So the project failure is partly because you didn't take action when you saw the risk. Is that fair to say?"

**Subordinate (Stage 4 - Assume Responsibility)**: "Yeah... I see that now. I should have escalated earlier. I should have pushed engineering harder on the specs. It's my problem that I didn't manage those stakeholders."

**Manager**: "Good. Now that we've identified that, what can we do differently next time?"

**Subordinate (Stage 5 - Find Solution)**: "I'll set up a weekly stakeholder review. I'll document any delays immediately. I'll escalate to you within 24 hours of any risk identification."

## Example 2: Fallback Procedure - Stuck at Blame Others

**Manager**: "We've discussed this for an hour. You keep saying it's everyone else's fault - the team, the budget, the timeline. But the project failed under your leadership."

**Subordinate**: "But I told you, the circumstances were impossible! Anyone would have failed!"

**Manager**: "I understand you don't see it my way. You may be right or I may be right. But I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions."

**Subordinate**: "What do you mean?"

**Manager**: "This is what I want you to do: Starting Monday, you will implement daily standup meetings. You will create a written risk register that you update weekly. You will send me a status report every Friday at 5 PM. You will do these things regardless of whether you agree they're necessary."

**Subordinate**: "But..."

**Manager**: "Do I have your commitment to follow these instructions?"

**Subordinate**: "...Yes. I'll do it."

**Manager**: "Good. I'll be monitoring your performance against this commitment. Let's meet again in two weeks to review progress."

## Example 3: High Achiever Development

**Manager**: "You exceeded all your targets this year. Sales up 40%, team satisfaction at 92%, you brought in three major accounts."

**High Achiever**: "Thanks! I worked hard."

**Manager**: "That's great. But I want to talk about next year. You're at the top of your current game. How do you get to the next level?"

**High Achiever**: "I'm not sure. Just keep doing what I'm doing?"

**Manager**: "That's the trap. If you just keep doing what you're doing, you'll plateau. Let me give you three specific challenges: First, I want you to mentor two junior reps to hit their targets. Second, I want you to develop a new market entry strategy for the healthcare vertical. Third, I want you to present at the national sales conference. These will stretch you into strategic thinking and leadership. Ready to take them on?"

**High Achiever**: "That's... a lot. But yes, I'm interested. Let's talk through each one."
