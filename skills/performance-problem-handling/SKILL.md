description: Handle major performance problems using the 'Blast' process to guide subordinates through resistance stages, and develop high achievers with future-oriented guidance. Use when a subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround, or when reviewing a high performer.

# Performance Problem Handling

## When to Use This Skill
- A subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing
- A subordinate is stuck in denial or blame stages
- Reviewing a high achiever who needs developmental guidance
- A subordinate's performance is at risk of termination

## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process

### Identify the Resistance Stage
Track the subordinate's current stage:

1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation

### Facilitate Progression Through Stages

**From Ignore to Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality

**From Deny to Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance

**From Blame Others to Assume Responsibility**: Guide the subordinate to take the "biggest step"
- This is an **emotional step** where the subordinate realizes "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
- This implies work and unpleasantness

**From Assume Responsibility to Find Solution**: Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task and relatively easier (intellectual step)

### Evaluate Possible Outcomes
1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')
1. Assume the formal role of supervisor endowed with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. Secure the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### Analyze Current Review Content
- Identify if the review is purely a "retrospective assessment" or focused on justifying a high rating
- Recognize the pitfall: Supervisors often justify superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better

### Contrast with Poor Performers
- Poor performers often receive detailed "corrective action programs"
- High achievers often lack future-oriented guidance

### Shift the Priority
Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to:
- Improve performance
- Maintain their current level

### Rationale
High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a **high-leverage activity** where the impact on group output is very great.

## Constraints
- Process cannot proceed to solution-finding if subordinate is stuck in denial or blame stages
- Does not apply to poor performers who require corrective action programs
