- Planning career development or advancement
- Facing competitive job market or industry changes

## Core Mindset Shift

**From Employee to Sole Proprietor:**
- You are NOT an employee
- You ARE a business with one employee: yourself
- You own your career—nobody owes you a career

**Competitive Reality:**
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- Fellow workers are NOT primary rivals
- You are outnumbered by people working for competing organizations (ratios of 1,000:1, 100,000:1, or 1,000,000:1)

## Daily Career Management Actions

1. **Continually dedicate yourself to retaining individual competitive advantage**
2. **Enhance your value every day**
3. **Hone your competitive advantage**
4. **Learn and adapt constantly**
5. **Be willing to move from job to job, or industry to industry**
6. **Retrench if necessary to start again**

**Goal:** Manage your career to avoid becoming a casualty of globalization and the information revolution.

## The Three-Question Self-Assessment Protocol

### Question 1: Value Addition

**Ask:** "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"

**Action:**
- Continually look for ways to make things truly better in your department
- Apply the principle: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization"
- Every hour should be spent increasing output or value of output for people you're responsible for

**Red Flags:**
- Just forwarding emails or messages
- Attending meetings without contributing
- Repeating work others have already done
- No measurable improvement from your efforts

### Question 2: Connectivity

**Ask:** "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"

**Scope:**
- Inside the company
- Within your industry
- In relevant technology trends
- In market developments

**Action:**
- Do NOT wait for supervisor to interpret events
- Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people"
- Build relationships across organization and industry
- Seek information proactively

**Red Flags:**
- Learning about changes after everyone else
- Relying solely on official communications
- No network outside immediate team
- Surprise by industry news

### Question 3: Innovation

**Ask:** "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"

**Action:**
- Personally try new things; do not just read about them
- Experiment with new tools and approaches
- Learn new skills before they're required
- Share innovations with others

**Warning:**
- Do NOT wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of that workplace

**Red Flags:**
- Using same tools and methods for years
- Resisting new technologies
- No personal learning or development
- Waiting for training to be provided

## Addressing Internal Threats

**Threat: Ambitious Junior Employees**
- In slow/no-growth environments, juniors desire upward movement
- Your position may block their advancement
- Boss faces dilemma: retain you (good performer, blocking others) or promote junior

**Take Responsibility:**
- Avoid being "in the way"
- Move up (seek promotion) or move on (find new role)
- Proactively manage your career trajectory
- Don't wait to be forced out

## Productivity Principles to Apply

1. **Apply methods of production** (see Output-Oriented Management)
2. **Exercise managerial leverage** (see Managerial Output and Leverage)
3. **Elicit an athlete's desire for peak performance**
