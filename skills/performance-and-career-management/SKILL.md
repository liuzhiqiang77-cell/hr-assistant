# Performance and Career Management

This skill provides frameworks for managing employee performance, making promotion decisions, and guiding career development in competitive global environments.

## Employee Performance Diagnosis

### When to Apply
- An employee is not performing their job duties
- Role and expectations are clearly defined
- Need to determine the root cause of underperformance

### Diagnosis Framework

#### Step 1: Identify Underperformance
Confirm the employee is not meeting job expectations.

#### Step 2: Categorize the Root Cause
Determine which of two buckets applies:

**Can't Do It (Capability Issue)**
- Employee lacks the skills, knowledge, or ability
- Training or development is needed

**Won't Do It (Motivation Issue)**
- Employee has the ability but lacks motivation
- Incentives, consequences, or motivational interventions are needed

#### Step 3: Select the Intervention

| Root Cause | Intervention |
|------------|-------------|
| Can't Do | Train the employee |
| Won't Do | Motivate the employee |

### Critical Constraint
There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train.

## The Peter Principle

### When to Apply
- Organization has hierarchical promotion structure
- Selection decisions are based on past performance data
- Evaluating promotion candidates
- Diagnosing why a manager is underperforming in their current role

### The Principle
**"In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."**

### How It Occurs

1. **Selection Criteria**: Candidate is selected based on performance in their current role

2. **Missing Criteria**: Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"

3. **Trajectory**: Employee continues to be promoted until they reach a role they are not skilled for

4. **Outcome**: Employee stops being promoted once no longer competent, resulting in managers rising to their level of incompetence

### Prevention Strategies

1. **Assess Intended Role Requirements**: Evaluate candidates based on skills needed for the new role, not current role success

2. **Competency-Based Selection**: Base promotion decisions on competencies specific to the intended position

3. **Trial Periods**: Test candidates in the new role before permanent promotion

### Constraints
- Does not apply if selection is based on competencies specific to the intended role
- Does not apply if skills required for the new role are identical to the current role

## Sole Proprietor Career Management Mindset

### When to Apply
- You are employed or seeking employment
- Operating in a globalized market
- Facing information revolution impacts
- No absolute job security exists

### Core Mindset Shift

**From Employee to Sole Proprietor**
- You are not an employee
- You are a business with one employee: yourself
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- "Nobody owes you a career"—you own it as a sole proprietor

### Identify Your Competition
- **Primary Rivals**: People working for competing organizations (outnumber fellow workers 100:1 to 1,000,000:1)
- **Secondary Rivals**: Fellow workers (not the primary threat)

### Daily Career Management Actions

1. **Retain Competitive Advantage**: Continuously dedicate yourself to maintaining your edge

2. **Enhance Value Daily**: Find ways to increase your worth every day

3. **Hone Your Advantage**: Sharpen your skills and capabilities

4. **Learn and Adapt**: Constantly acquire new knowledge

5. **Be Mobile**: Willing to move from job to job, industry to industry

6. **Retrench if Necessary**: Start again when needed

### The Three Self-Assessment Questions

#### Question 1: Value Addition
**Ask**: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"

**Action**: Continually look for ways to make things truly better in your department

**Principle**: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization"

**Standard**: Every hour should be spent increasing the output or value of the people you're responsible for

#### Question 2: Connectivity
**Ask**: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?" (inside company and industry)

**Check**: Do not wait for a supervisor to interpret events

**Status**: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people" rather than "floating by yourself"

#### Question 3: Innovation
**Ask**: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"

**Action**: Personally try new things; do not just read about them

**Warning**: Do not wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of that workplace

### Address Internal Threats

**Threat**: Ambitious junior employees who desire upward movement but are blocked by your position in slow/no-growth environments

**Boss's Dilemma**: Choosing between retaining you (doing good job but blocking others) or promoting the junior

**Your Responsibility**: Avoid being "in the way"—move up or move on

### Apply Productivity Principles
- Apply methods of production to your work
- Exercise managerial leverage
- Elicit an athlete's desire for peak performance

### Constraints
- Does not apply to environments with absolute job security (rare/non-existent)
