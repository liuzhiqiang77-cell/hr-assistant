# The Sole Proprietor Career Management Mindset

## The Fundamental Shift

### Traditional Employee Mindset
- "I work for this company"
- "The company owes me a career"
- "My job security comes from my employer"
- "My competition is my coworkers"
- "I'll stay here until retirement"

### Sole Proprietor Mindset
- "I am a business with one employee: myself"
- "I own my career—nobody owes it to me"
- "My job security comes from my competitive advantage"
- "My competition is millions of people globally"
- "I'll go where my value is highest"

## The Competitive Landscape

### Who Are Your Rivals?

**Not your coworkers**:
- You work with 10, 100, or 1000 coworkers
- They are outnumbered by your true competition
- Ratios of 1000:1, 100,000:1, or 1,000,000:1

**Your true rivals**:
- People doing similar work at competing companies
- People doing similar work in other countries
- People who could do your work with minimal training
- People willing to do your work for less pay

### The Global Reality

**Before Globalization**:
- Competition was local or regional
- Skills had geographic protection
- Career paths were predictable
- Job security was more common

**After Globalization**:
- Competition is global
- Skills can be sourced anywhere
- Career paths are unpredictable
- Job security is obsolete

### The Information Revolution Impact

**Before Digital Age**:
- Information traveled slowly
- Knowledge had geographic advantages
- Local expertise was valuable
- Hiding places existed

**After Digital Age**:
- Information travels instantly
- Knowledge is globally accessible
- Local expertise is less protected
- "The information revolution does away with hiding places anywhere, in any line of work"

## Internal Threats: The Junior Employee Dilemma

### The Situation
- You're in a slow-growth or no-growth environment
- Ambitious junior employees want upward movement
- Your position blocks their path
- Your boss faces a dilemma

### The Boss's Dilemma
**Option A**: Keep you
- You're doing a good job
- But you're blocking others
- Junior may leave if not promoted
- Team morale may suffer

**Option B**: Promote the junior
- Junior is eager and capable
- But you lose your position
- You may need to move on
- Disruption to team

### Your Responsibility
**Don't be "in the way"**
- Move up: Seek promotion yourself
- Move on: Find new opportunity elsewhere
- Move aside: Help transition to new role

**Why this matters**:
- Blocking others damages your reputation
- Stagnation hurts your own career
- Being seen as obstacle reduces future options
- Helping others builds goodwill and network
