# Performance Diagnosis Flowchart

## Step 1: Identify Performance Gap
```
Is employee meeting expectations?
│
├─ Yes → No action needed (or look for stretch opportunities)
│
└─ No → Proceed to Step 2
```

## Step 2: Assess Capability
```
Does employee have necessary skills/knowledge?
│
├─ No → CAPABILITY ISSUE
│   │
│   └─ Solution: TRAIN
│       - Identify specific skill gaps
│       - Provide training/mentoring
│       - Set learning goals
│       - Allow practice time
│       - Reassess after training
│
└─ Yes → Proceed to Step 3
```

## Step 3: Assess Motivation
```
Is employee willing and engaged?
│
├─ No → MOTIVATION ISSUE
│   │
│   └─ Solution: MOTIVATE
│       - Understand what drives them
│       - Connect work to their goals
│       - Provide recognition/rewards
│       - Remove demotivators
│       - Set clear expectations
│       - Provide autonomy where possible
│
└─ Yes → Reassess (may be external factor)
```

## Step 4: Monitor and Adjust
```
After intervention:
│
├─ Performance improved → Continue support
│
├─ No improvement → Re-diagnose
│   │
│   ├─ Was it really capability? → Try motivation
│   │
│   ├─ Was it really motivation? → Try training
│   │
│   └─ Both attempted? → Consider role mismatch
│
└─ Still no improvement → Performance management process
```

## Common Diagnosis Errors

**Error 1: Assuming motivation when it's capability**
- Symptom: Employee tries but fails
- Reality: Lacks skills, not will
- Fix: Assess actual ability, not effort

**Error 2: Assuming capability when it's motivation**
- Symptom: Employee capable but not delivering
- Reality: Has skills, lacks drive
- Fix: Understand underlying motivation issues

**Error 3: Treating symptoms, not root cause**
- Symptom: Missed deadlines
- Root cause: Poor prioritization (capability) or lack of urgency (motivation)
- Fix: Diagnose before intervening
