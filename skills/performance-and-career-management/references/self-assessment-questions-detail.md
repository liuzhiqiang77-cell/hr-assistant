# The 3 Self-Assessment Questions

## Question 1: Value Addition

**Ask**: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"

**Action**: Continually look for ways to make things truly better in your department.

**Principle**: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization."

**Standard**: Every hour of the day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people you are responsible for.

**Indicators you're adding value**:
- Problems get solved and stay solved
- Processes improve and stay improved
- Team capabilities increase over time
- Decisions you make lead to measurable results

**Indicators you're just passing information**:
- You're primarily a communication conduit
- Problems recur after you "handle" them
- Your involvement doesn't change outcomes
- People bypass you to get real work done

## Question 2: Connectivity

**Ask**: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"

**Scope**: Inside the company AND in the industry.

**Check**: Do not wait for a supervisor to interpret events.

**Status**: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people" rather than "floating by yourself."

**Actions to improve connectivity**:
- Build relationships across departments
- Attend industry events and conferences
- Read industry publications and news
- Participate in cross-functional projects
- Maintain a network of peers outside your company
- Seek information directly, don't wait for it to be filtered

**Risks of poor connectivity**:
- You're blindsided by changes
- Your knowledge becomes obsolete
- You miss opportunities
- You can't anticipate threats

## Question 3: Innovation

**Ask**: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"

**Action**: Personally try new things; do not just read about them.

**Warning**: Do not wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of that workplace.

**Innovation examples**:
- Learn new software tools relevant to your work
- Experiment with new communication methods
- Test new productivity techniques
- Explore emerging technologies in your field
- Apply new management approaches
- Try different problem-solving methods

**Risks of not innovating**:
- Your skills become outdated
- You're replaced by someone more current
- You can't adapt to changing requirements
- You become resistant to necessary change
