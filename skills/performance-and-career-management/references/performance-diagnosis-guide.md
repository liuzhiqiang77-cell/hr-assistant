# Employee Performance Diagnosis: Detailed Guide

## Step-by-Step Diagnosis Process

### Step 1: Define the Performance Gap

**Questions to Ask**:
- What specific behavior or outcome is missing?
- What does "good performance" look like in this role?
- How big is the gap between current and expected performance?
- How long has this gap existed?

**Documentation Needed**:
- Specific examples of underperformance
- Metrics or objective measures where possible
- Timeline of performance decline

### Step 2: Gather Information

**Sources**:
- Direct observation
- Work output and deliverables
- Feedback from peers and customers
- Employee's own perspective

**Approach**:
- "I've noticed [specific gap]. Help me understand what's happening."
- "What obstacles are you facing?"
- "What support do you need?"

### Step 3: Determine Root Cause

#### Signs It's "Can't Do" (Capability Issue)
- Employee tries but fails to meet standards
- Lack of necessary skills or knowledge
- Confusion about expectations or processes
- Inability to use tools or systems
- Performance varies by task (some done well, others poorly)

#### Signs It's "Won't Do" (Motivation Issue)
- Employee has demonstrated capability in the past
- Performance is consistently below capability
- Employee shows lack of effort or engagement
- Excuses and blame-shifting are common
- Performance improves temporarily with external pressure

### Step 4: Select and Implement Intervention

#### For "Can't Do" Issues

**Training Approaches**:
- Formal training courses
- On-the-job coaching
- Mentoring from high performers
- Job shadowing
- Written procedures and checklists

**Support Approaches**:
- Better tools or resources
- Simplified processes
- Clearer instructions
- More time for learning
- Reduced workload during training

#### For "Won't Do" Issues

**Motivation Approaches**:
- Connect work to personal goals and values
- Provide recognition for achievements
- Create friendly competition
- Offer incentives or rewards
- Explain impact of their work

**Accountability Approaches**:
- Clear consequences for continued underperformance
- Performance improvement plans with specific milestones
- Regular check-ins and feedback
- Documented discussions

### Step 5: Monitor and Adjust

**Timeline**:
- Check in weekly for first month
- Bi-weekly for second month
- Monthly thereafter

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Is performance improving?
- Is the intervention working?
- Does the approach need adjustment?

## When Neither Training Nor Motivation Works

### Possible Explanations
1. **Wrong Role Fit**: Employee's strengths don't match role requirements
2. **Personal Issues**: Health, family, or other external factors
3. **Toxic Environment**: Team dynamics or culture issues
4. **Mismatched Expectations**: Role has changed or was never clearly defined

### Next Steps
1. **Reassess Role Fit**: Would this person excel elsewhere in the organization?
2. **Address Personal Issues**: Provide support or accommodations if possible
3. **Consider Transition**: Plan for role change or exit
4. **Document Everything**: Protect organization and provide clarity to employee

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Assuming motivation when it's capability**: "They just don't care" when they actually don't know how
2. **Assuming capability when it's motivation**: Providing training when the issue is unwillingness
3. **Waiting too long**: Address issues early, before patterns solidify
4. **One-size-fits-all**: Different employees need different approaches
5. **Focusing on blame**: Focus on solutions and improvement
