# Performance Review Core Principles

This skill establishes the foundational principles and protocols for conducting effective performance reviews that drive actual performance improvement.

## When to Use
- Conducting any performance review or evaluation
- Designing a performance review system
- Assessing manager or subordinate performance
- Preparing written performance documentation

## Fundamental Purpose

The primary goal of any performance review is to **improve the subordinate's performance**.

### Focus Areas

1. **Skill Level**
   - Determine what skills are missing
   - Find ways to remedy the lack of skills

2. **Motivation**
   - Intensify the subordinate's motivation
   - Move the subordinate to a "higher performance curve" for the same skill level

### Secondary Purposes

While valid, these should not overshadow the primary purpose:
- Assessing work
- Motivating
- Providing feedback
- Justifying raises
- Rewarding
- Discipline
- Direction
- Reinforcing culture

## Time Offset and Long-Term Assessment

### The "Light from Distant Stars" Principle

Current output may reflect work done months or years ago. Account for this lag when evaluating performance.

### Evaluation Guidelines

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Tangible output absent but activities strong | Give credit for performance (building future capacity) |
| Future-oriented activities (e.g., improving design methods) | Apply "present value" concept to estimate current worth |
| Immediate outputs (e.g., meeting schedule) | Weigh against long-term value creation |

### Present Value Calculation

Estimate how much the future-oriented activity will pay back over time, then determine what that future value is worth today.

## The Potential Trap Rule

### Core Principle

**The performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the rating accorded to his organization.**

### Application

1. **Assess Substance over Form**
   - Evaluate actual performance and real output
   - Ignore "potential" defined as form (knowledge, handling oneself well, looking like a manager)

2. **Apply the Organization Cap**
   - Compare manager's rating to organization's rating
   - Enforce: Manager Rating ≤ Organization Rating

3. **Consequences for Poor Organizational Performance**
   - If the business unit lost money, missed revenue forecasts, slipped schedules, or showed poor internal measures, the manager cannot receive a high rating
   - Reject excuses that "the organization failed but the manager is outstanding"

4. **Prevent Negative Signaling**
   - Avoid signaling that "acting" like a manager is sufficient
   - Reinforce that performing like a manager is the requirement

## Review Integrity and Delivery Protocols

### Handling Self-Reviews

- **Do not ask for a self-review** if you intend to simply change the format, retype it, and hand it back
- If you rely on the subordinate to tell you their accomplishments, you appear unaware and the subordinate feels cheated
- **Preserve integrity**: Make an upfront assessment of performance without being prompted by the subordinate

### Handling Upward Feedback

- You may ask the subordinate to evaluate your performance as a supervisor
- **Constraint**: Clearly state that their assessment has only "advisory status"
- **Constraint**: Never pretend you and subordinates are equals; you are the leader

### Timing of Written Review Delivery

| Option | Recommendation | Risks |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| During Discussion | NOT Recommended | Subordinate reads ahead, cannot stop to discuss, no time to think |
| After Discussion | NOT Recommended | Subordinate may find phrases they didn't "hear" and react negatively |
| Before Discussion | RECOMMENDED | Allows subordinate time to process reactions before meeting |

### Enforcing Quality

- If a review is superficial, lacks analysis, or lacks depth, **insist on a rewrite**
- The integrity of the performance review system is more important than the subordinate's preference to not spend time on it

## Key Constraints

- Does not apply if the goal is purely administrative without developmental intent
- Requires judgment beyond simple metrics for time offset analysis
- Supervisors must not abdicate judgment to subordinates

## Expected Outcome

- Reviews focused on performance improvement rather than retrospective assessment
- Fair evaluation accounting for delayed results and future value
- Manager ratings constrained by organizational performance
- Reviews delivered with integrity and proper processing time

## Variables

- `skill_level` (Qualitative Assessment): Current capability and competency
- `motivation_level` (Qualitative Assessment): Drive and engagement
- `time_offset` (Duration): Lag between activity and visible result
- `present_value` (Financial/Strategic Estimate): Current worth of future-oriented activities
- `manager_rating` (Score/Grade): Proposed performance rating for manager
- `organization_rating` (Score/Grade): Performance rating from organization's output
