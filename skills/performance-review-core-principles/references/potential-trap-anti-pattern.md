# The Potential Trap Anti-Pattern

## Definition

The "Potential Trap" occurs when managers are rated highly based on perceived potential (form) rather than actual organizational performance (substance).

## Common Manifestations

1. **Appearance-Based Evaluation**: Rating managers highly because they "look like a manager" or handle themselves well
2. **Knowledge Confusion**: Equating having knowledge with producing results
3. **Excuse Acceptance**: Accepting that "the organization failed but the manager is outstanding"

## Why This Matters

- Signals that "acting" like a manager is sufficient
- Undermines accountability for actual results
- Creates a culture of form over substance
- Demotivates managers who deliver real results

## Enforcement Examples

| Organization Performance | Maximum Manager Rating |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Lost money, missed forecasts | Below Average or Poor |
| Slipped schedules, poor internal measures | Average or Below |
| Met all objectives, strong growth | Excellent or Outstanding |
