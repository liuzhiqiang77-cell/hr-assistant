# Candidate Interviewing Assessment

Use this skill when you need to:
- Conduct an interview session with a job candidate
- Plan interview strategy and approach
- Check candidate references
- Make hiring decisions based on interviews and references

## Core Principles

- **Judge based on past performance**: Project a candidate's potential contribution in a new environment by analyzing their past performance
- **Maintain honesty**: Do not use tricks or deceptive tests (e.g., three-legged chair). Show yourself and the environment as they really are
- **Accept limitations**: Careful interviewing does not guarantee success; it only increases the odds of making good hires

## Interview Execution

### 1. Ask Specific Assessment Questions

Cover these categories to ensure comprehensive coverage:

**Technical/Skills Assessment**
- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"

**Past Application of Knowledge**
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"
- "What are some of the problems you encountered in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them?"

**Discrepancies and Learning**
- Ask about past failures and what they learned from them
- Explore problems in their current role and prevention strategies

**Operational Values**
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"

### 2. Use Direct Questions

- Ask blunt questions to elicit direct responses (e.g., "How good are you technically?")
- Observe the candidate's reaction and confidence level to gauge actual capability
- Timidity in answering direct questions often indicates weaker capability

### 3. Employ Hypothetical Situations

- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps)
- Ask them to solve a concrete problem or calculate a specific result (e.g., finished cost of a wafer)
- This reveals their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly

### 4. Invite Candidate Questions

- Ask the candidate what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job
- Analyze their questions to assess:
  - What they already know about the role/company
  - What they value professionally
  - How prepared they are for the interview

## Reference Checking Protocol

### 1. Establish Rapport

- If you know the reference personally, leverage that connection for honest information
- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experiences or associations to increase openness
- **Critical timing**: The last 10 minutes of a half-hour call are more valuable than the first 10 due to established rapport

### 2. Gather Consistent Information

- Goal: Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly
- Compare reference responses with candidate's own answers to identify discrepancies

## Post-Interview Actions

### 1. Follow-Up Interviews

- If possible, conduct a second interview after checking references
- Use this time to address new perspectives or concerns raised by reference checks

### 2. Make Decision with Risk Awareness

- Recognize that interviewing increases but does not guarantee success
- Acknowledge the inherent risk in any hiring decision
- Make the final call based on the comprehensive assessment of skills, values, and references
