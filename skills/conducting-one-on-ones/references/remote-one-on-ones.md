# Remote One-on-One Considerations

## Additional Preparation Required

### Before the Meeting
- Supervisor must receive the outline BEFORE the session begins
- Review and prepare questions based on the outline
- Ensure all relevant documents and screen shares are ready

### During the Meeting
- Be aware that visual cues are missing
- Check for understanding more frequently
- Allow for longer pauses to account for remote communication latency

### After the Meeting
- **Exchange notes** to ensure clarity on commitments and action items
- This documentation is critical when you cannot observe body language or work environment

## Observation Limitations

When meeting remotely, you lose the ability to:
- Observe the subordinate's work organization
- See document retrieval efficiency
- Monitor interruption patterns
- Assess general work approach visually

**Compensation:** Ask specific questions about these areas during the meeting.
