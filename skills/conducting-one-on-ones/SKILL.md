# Conducting One-on-One Meetings

One-on-ones are absolutely necessary for mutual education, exchanging information, and coaching. Their scope focuses on specific problems, skills, and concerns—not general status updates.

## When to Use This Skill

- Establishing a recurring cadence with a new direct report
- Adjusting meeting frequency as a subordinate's role or experience changes
- Preparing for or conducting a scheduled one-on-one session
- Adapting your meeting approach when electronic communication systems are available

## Determine Meeting Frequency

### Base Frequency by Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

**Inexperienced in specific situation:** Meet frequently (e.g., once a week)
**Experienced veteran:** Meet less frequently (e.g., once every few weeks)

**Important:** TRM is experience with the specific task, not general experience or age.

### Adjust for Rate of Change

- **High Rate of Change** (e.g., Marketing, Sales): Increase frequency to stay current on rapid developments
- **Low Rate of Change** (e.g., Research, Stable Operations): Decrease frequency—quieter environment means less frequent meetings may suffice

### Adapt for Electronic Communication

When team members have access to email and computer networks:
- **Reduce frequency:** Do not attempt to meet as often with more direct reports (e.g., 10) as with fewer (e.g., 5)
- **Shorten duration:** Conduct shorter meetings compared to previous standards
- **Narrow purpose:** Focus on coaching and specific issues not covered by electronic updates

## Meeting Logistics

### Duration
- **Minimum:** 1 hour
- **Reasoning:** Anything less (e.g., 15 minutes) confines discussion to simple issues; big problems need time to explore

### Location
- **Preferred:** In or near the subordinate's work area
- **Benefits:** You can observe organization, document retrieval efficiency, interruption frequency, and work approach

### Scheduling Method
- **Use a rolling basis:** Set up the next meeting as the current one ends
- **Avoid fixed schedules** (e.g., "every second Wednesday") which are prone to cancellations due to vacations or conflicts

### Ownership
- **This is the subordinate's meeting**
- Agenda and tone are set by the subordinate
- Subordinate must prepare an outline in advance

## Preparation

### Subordinate Responsibilities
- Prepare an outline listing agenda items
- Think through issues in advance

### Supervisor Responsibilities
- Review the outline before the meeting
- For remote/long-distance meetings: Have the outline before the session begins and exchange notes after to ensure clarity on commitments

## Meeting Content and Dynamics

### Content Scope

1. **Performance figures and indicators** (e.g., incoming order rates, production output, project status)
   - Emphasize indicators that signal trouble

2. **Events since last meeting:** Hiring problems, people problems, organizational problems, future plans

3. **Potential problems:** Even intangible intuitions that "something is wrong"—these trigger investigation into the organizational black box

4. **Issues that preoccupy the subordinate:** Select items that are nagging and time-consuming, even if obscure

### Supervisor Role: Facilitate and Coach

**Objective:** Facilitate the subordinate's expression of concerns, learn, and coach.

**Grove's Principle of Didactic Management:**
> "Ask one more question!"

When you think the subordinate is finished, ask another query to keep thoughts flowing until you reach the root of the problem.

### Mechanical Techniques

**Note-Taking:**
- Both parties take notes on the outline
- Keeps mind from drifting, aids digestion, forces logical categorization
- **Symbolism:** Writing down a suggestion implies a commitment (like a handshake)

**Hold File:**
- Both parties accumulate important but non-urgent issues in this file
- Applies batching principle to minimize ad hoc interruptions (phone calls, drop-ins)
- Discuss these accumulated items at the next scheduled meeting

### Heart-to-Heart Issues

- Encourage discussion of deep work-related problems (satisfaction, frustration, doubts)
- **WARNING: Beware the "Zinger"**
  - A sensitive or critical issue raised at the very end of a meeting
  - Risk: Subordinate drops a major issue (e.g., quitting) with insufficient time to resolve it
  - **Solution:** If a Zinger emerges, acknowledge it and schedule immediate follow-up time to address it properly
