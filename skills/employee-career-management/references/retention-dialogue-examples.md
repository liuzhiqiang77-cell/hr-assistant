# Retention Dialogue Examples

## Opening Dialogue Examples

**Manager**: "I was surprised to hear you're leaving. Can you tell me what's behind this decision?"

**Subordinate**: [Delivers rehearsed reasons]

**Manager**: "I hear what you're saying. Let me ask—what's really driving this? Is there something specific we could have done differently?"

## Reframing the Solution

**Manager**: "You did not blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways. This solution is right for you and right for the company."

## Countering External Offers

**Manager**: "I understand you've made a commitment to another company. But think about this—you've made two commitments: one to a vague potential employer you barely know, and one to me and your team who you've worked with daily for years. Which commitment is stronger?"

## Recycling Conversation

**Manager**: "I want to talk about your current role. Looking at your performance over the past six months, I realize we may have moved you into this position too quickly. That's on me—I misjudged the readiness. I'd like to discuss moving you back to your previous role where you were excelling."

**Manager**: "This isn't a punishment. It's about putting you in a position where you can succeed and build confidence. Many of our best leaders have taken a step back before stepping forward again."
