## Promotion Cycle Examples

### Example 1: Successful Progression
**Year 1**: Software Engineer (Job 1) - "Meets Requirements" - Delivers assigned features on time
**Year 2**: Software Engineer (Job 1) - "Exceeds Requirements" - Delivers early, mentors others, improves processes
**Year 3**: Promoted to Senior Engineer (Job 2) - "Meets Requirements" - Learning architectural responsibilities
**Year 4**: Senior Engineer (Job 2) - "Exceeds Requirements" - Leads major projects, architects systems
**Year 5**: Promoted to Tech Lead (Job 3) - Cycle continues...

### Example 2: Atrophy Risk
**Current State**: Senior Engineer "Exceeds Requirements" - Ready for Tech Lead role
**Problem**: No Tech Lead positions available; manager keeps employee in current role
**Risk**: Without new challenges, employee's performance will atrophy back to "Meets Requirements"
**Solution**: Find alternative growth path (special projects, cross-team leadership, new domain)

### Example 3: Level of Incompetence
**History**: Successfully promoted through Engineer → Senior → Lead → Manager
**Current**: Engineering Manager, performance at "Meets Requirements" for 3 years
**Assessment**: Reached level of incompetence; struggling with director-level responsibilities
**Action**: Do not promote. Consider lateral development or specialization.

## Recycling Examples

### Example 1: Failed Promotion to Management
**Background**: Excellent Senior Engineer, promoted to Engineering Manager
**Problem**: After 8 months, struggling with people management, team morale declining, "Meets Requirements" not achieved
**Root Cause**: Technical skills strong, management skills underdeveloped; management misjudged readiness
**Recycling**: Return to Senior Engineer role with additional responsibility (technical lead, mentor)
**Execution**: 
- Manager meets with employee privately
- Admits: "I promoted you too quickly. We should have developed your management skills first."
- Propose return to Senior Engineer with path to future management opportunity
- Support publicly: "John is returning to Senior Engineer to focus on technical leadership while developing management skills."
**Outcome**: Employee regains confidence, excels technically, promoted to Manager successfully 18 months later

### Example 2: Cross-Functional Promotion Failure
**Background**: Strong Sales Representative, promoted to Marketing Manager
**Problem**: After 6 months, struggling with marketing strategy, campaigns underperforming
**Root Cause**: Sales and marketing require different skill sets; misfit
**Recycling**: Return to Sales Representative with potential for Sales Manager role
**Outcome**: Employee returns to excellence in sales, promoted to Sales Manager 12 months later
