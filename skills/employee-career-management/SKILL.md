# Employee Career Management

Manage employee progression through the promotion cycle and implement recycling (demotion) for over-promoted employees.

## When to Use
- Employee "exceeds requirements" and is being considered for promotion
- Promoted employee performs below-average for extended period
- Employee appears to have reached their "level of incompetence"
- Considering whether to promote or recycle an employee

## Promotion Performance Cycle Logic

Follow the performance-promotion cycle to advance employees appropriately:

### Cycle Steps

1. **Initial State**: Employee at Job 1 performing at "average" level (meets requirements)

2. **Improvement Phase**: With training and motivation, performance improves to "above-average" (exceeds requirements)

3. **Promotion Trigger**: Once employee "exceeds requirements," they are "promotable" and promoted to Job 2

4. **Performance Reset**: Upon entering Job 2, employee initially performs at "meets requirements" level due to new challenges

5. **Cycle Repetition**: With experience in Job 2, employee again improves to "exceeds requirements," leading to another promotion

6. **Cycle Conclusion**: Cycle repeats until employee settles at "meets requirements" and is no longer promoted (reaches "level of incompetence")

### Critical Constraint
- If employee "exceeds requirements" but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will "atrophy"
- Performance will permanently return to "meets requirements"

## Employee Recycling Procedure

Use when a promoted employee performs below-average for an extended time and is "over their head."

### Process Steps

1. **Identification**: Recognize employee has been promoted into a position "so much over their head" that they perform below-average for extended time

2. **Solution Selection**: Choose to "recycle" rather than terminate

3. **Definition of Recycling**: Put employee back into the job they did well before the promotion

4. **Management Accountability**: Admit management was "at fault for misjudging employee's readiness"

5. **Implementation**: Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place person in job they can do

6. **Support System**: Support employee in face of likely "embarrassment"

7. **Transparency**: Execute recycling "openly" to reduce stigma

8. **Expected Outcome**: Embarrassment will be "short-lived" and employee will regain confidence

9. **Future Value**: Once confidence regained, employee becomes "excellent candidate for another promotion" at later time and is likely to succeed

### Prohibited Action
- **Do NOT** force employee to leave company
- **Reject** rationalization: "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake"

## Key Principles
- Promotion follows improvement: meets requirements → exceeds requirements → promotion → reset
- Failure to promote "exceeds requirements" employees causes atrophy
- Recycling is better than termination for over-promoted employees
- Management must accept responsibility for misjudgment
- Transparency and support reduce stigma and enable future success

## Constraints
- Does not apply to "noncompetitors" who have no motivation to do more
- Recycling requires overcoming societal stigma regarding demotion
- Requires management to view demotion as organizational tool, not personal failure
