# The 3 Questions: Detailed Self-Assessment Guide

## Question 1: Value Addition

### The Core Question:
"Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"

### Why This Matters:

In the information age, passing information is easy and increasingly automated. Adding real value—transforming information into insight, decisions, or action—is what creates competitive advantage.

### Assessment Criteria:

**You ARE adding real value if:**
- Your work enables others to be more effective
- You solve problems, not just report them
- You make decisions that move work forward
- You improve processes or outcomes
- Your absence would be noticed and impactful

**You are MERELY PASSING INFORMATION if:**
- You forward emails without adding context
- You report status without analysis
- You schedule meetings without clear purpose
- You attend meetings without contributing
- Your work could be automated or eliminated

### Action Steps:

1. **Audit Your Work:** For each task, ask: "What value does this create?"
2. **Eliminate Low-Value Activities:** Stop or delegate information-passing tasks
3. **Transform Information:** Always add analysis, insight, or action to information
4. **Focus on Output:** Measure yourself by results, not activity
5. **Seek Feedback:** Ask stakeholders: "What value do I provide for you?"

### Examples:

**Low Value (Passing Information):**
- Forwarding a competitor's press release to the team
- Reporting that sales are down 10% this month
- Scheduling a weekly status meeting

**High Value (Adding Real Value):**
- Analyzing the competitor's press release and identifying 3 strategic implications
- Investigating why sales are down and proposing 2 corrective actions
- Running a weekly meeting that results in 3 decisions and clear action items

## Question 2: Connectivity

### The Core Question:
"Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"

### Why This Matters:

Information is the currency of the modern workplace. Being connected to information flows enables better decisions, faster responses, and greater influence.

### Assessment Criteria:

**You ARE plugged in if:**
- You learn about important company news before it's officially announced
- You understand industry trends and their implications
- You have relationships across functions and levels
- You know who to go to for what information
- You're sought out for your knowledge and insights

**You are NOT plugged in if:**
- You rely on your supervisor to interpret events for you
- You're surprised by organizational changes
- You don't know people outside your immediate team
- You're unaware of industry developments
- You work in isolation

### Action Steps:

1. **Map Your Network:** Identify who you know and who you should know
2. **Expand Your Network:** Build relationships across functions and levels
3. **Diversify Information Sources:** Read industry publications, attend events, follow thought leaders
4. **Share Information Generously:** Be a source, not just a consumer
5. **Create Connection Opportunities:** Organize cross-functional projects, lunches, or discussions

### Examples:

**Low Connectivity:**
- Only talking to people on your immediate team
- Waiting for your manager to tell you what's happening
- Not reading industry news or trends
- Working in a silo

**High Connectivity:**
- Having regular coffee chats with people in other departments
- Subscribing to and reading industry newsletters
- Attending cross-functional meetings and events
- Being the person others come to for information and insights

## Question 3: Innovation

### The Core Question:
"Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"

### Why This Matters:

The pace of change is accelerating. Those who don't experiment and learn continuously will be left behind. Innovation isn't just for R&D—it's a personal responsibility.

### Assessment Criteria:

**You ARE innovating if:**
- You regularly try new tools or technologies
- You experiment with new approaches to your work
- You learn from failures and iterate
- You share your experiments and learnings with others
- You're comfortable with uncertainty and change

**You are NOT innovating if:**
- You do things the way they've always been done
- You wait for others to figure out new approaches
- You're afraid to fail or look foolish
- You read about new things but don't try them
- You resist change

### Action Steps:

1. **Start Small:** Try one new tool or technique this week
2. **Create Experiments:** Treat new approaches as experiments, not commitments
3. **Embrace Failure:** View failures as learning opportunities
4. **Share Learnings:** Document and share what works and what doesn't
5. **Build a Learning Habit:** Dedicate time each week to learning and experimentation

### Examples:

**Low Innovation:**
- Using the same tools and processes you've used for years
- Waiting for IT to roll out new technologies
- Avoiding new projects or approaches
- Saying "that's not how we do things here"

**High Innovation:**
- Testing a new project management tool and sharing results with the team
- Learning a new programming language or data analysis technique
- Proposing and piloting a new process improvement
- Attending a workshop outside your immediate field and applying learnings
