# Delegation Monitoring

## When to Use
- When a task has been delegated to a subordinate
- When oversight is needed to ensure the activity proceeds in line with expectations
- When quality assurance monitoring is required

## Purpose
Monitoring ensures the activity proceeds in line with expectations and is the only practical way to ensure a result.

## Quality Assurance Principle 1: Timing

**Monitor at the "Lowest-Added-Value Stage" of the process**

**Definition:**
- The earliest point in a process where basic problems can be identified before expensive polishing

**Example:**
- Review rough drafts of reports rather than waiting for final polished versions
- This catches basic content problems early

## Quality Assurance Principle 2: Sampling

**Do NOT check 100% of details**

**Actions:**
- Go into details randomly
- Check just enough to ensure satisfactory progress
- Analogous to not doing 100% QA testing

## Determine Frequency Based on Task-Relevant Maturity

**Definition of Maturity:**
- The subordinate's experience with the specific task
- Their prior performance with it
- NOT general ability

**Adjustment:**
- Increase monitoring frequency for newly delegated tasks
- Decrease intensity as the subordinate's work improves over time

## Avoid Meddling

**Constraint:**
- Monitoring should not become meddling (prescribing specific activities)

**Key Distinction:**
- **Monitoring**: Ensuring progress and quality
- **Meddling**: Prescribing specific activities and methods
