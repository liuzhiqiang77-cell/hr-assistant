# Effective One-on-One Meetings

One-on-one meetings are the primary mechanism for mutual education, information exchange, and coaching between managers and subordinates. They enable early problem detection and relationship building.

## When to Use

- You have direct reports requiring supervision and coaching
- Subordinates have varying Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) levels
- Work area has a high rate of change requiring frequent updates
- You need to monitor delegated tasks and provide feedback
- Electronic communication exists but cannot replace personal interaction

## Determine Meeting Frequency

Assess the subordinate's **Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)**—their experience with the specific task at hand, not general experience or age.

- **Low TRM (inexperienced)**: Meet weekly
- **High TRM (experienced veteran)**: Meet every few weeks

Adjust based on the **rate of change** in the job area:
- **High rate of change** (e.g., Marketing): Increase frequency
- **Low rate of change** (e.g., Research): Decrease frequency

If electronic information sharing is available and span of control is large (10+ reports), reduce both frequency and duration, focusing on coaching rather than status updates.

## Prepare for the Meeting

1. **Duration**: Minimum 1 hour. Less time prevents discussion of complex problems.
2. **Location**: In or near the subordinate's work area to observe organization and workflow.
3. **Ownership**: The meeting belongs to the subordinate.
4. **Agenda**: Subordinate prepares an outline in advance.
5. **Scheduling**: Set the next meeting as the current one ends (rolling basis).

For remote meetings, obtain the outline beforehand and exchange notes afterward.

## Conduct the Meeting

### Content Scope

Cover these categories:
- **Performance indicators**: Metrics that signal trouble
- **Events since last meeting**: Hiring, people issues, organizational problems, future plans
- **Potential problems**: Intangible concerns or intuitions
- **Nagging issues**: Problems that preoccupy the subordinate

### Interaction Dynamics

- **Facilitate, don't dominate**: Let the subordinate drive the discussion
- **Apply Grove's Principle of Didactic Management**: "Ask one more question!" when you think the conversation is finished
- **Take notes**: Both parties note on the outline to maintain focus and signal commitment
- **Use a Hold File**: Accumulate non-urgent issues for the next meeting (batching principle)

### Watch for "Zingers"

Beware of critical issues raised at the very end of the meeting when there's insufficient time to address them. If a "zinger" appears, acknowledge it and schedule dedicated time.

## Adapt for Modern Contexts

When electronic communication systems provide basic updates:
- Reduce meeting frequency
- Shorten duration
- Focus exclusively on coaching, skill transfer, and specific problem-solving
- Eliminate general status updates covered by email/networks
