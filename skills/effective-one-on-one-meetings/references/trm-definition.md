# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

## Definition

Task-Relevant Maturity is a combination of:
- The degree of the subordinate's achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience

## Key Characteristics

- **Task-specific**: TRM is very specific to the task at hand. A person can have high TRM in one job but low TRM in another.
- **Dynamic**: TRM can change day by day or hour by hour.
- **Not general maturity**: Do not confuse general competence and maturity with task-relevant maturity. High general maturity does not guarantee high TRM in a new role.

## Factors Causing Low TRM

Even a seasoned manager may have low TRM if:
- The environment is new to them
- The content is unfamiliar
- The tasks are different from previous experience
- The pace of the job accelerates
- The job itself abruptly changes

## TRM Levels

- **Low**: New to the task, needs close supervision
- **Medium/Growing**: Gaining experience, needs moderate supervision
- **High**: Experienced in the specific task, needs minimal supervision
