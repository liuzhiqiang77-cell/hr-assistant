# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) Reference

## Definition

Task-Relevant Maturity is a combination of:
- The degree of the subordinate's achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience

## Key Characteristics

- **Task-specific**: TRM is very specific to the task at hand. A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another.
- **Dynamic**: TRM can change day by day or hour by hour.
- **Context-dependent**: Even a seasoned manager may have low TRM if the environment, content, and tasks are new to them.

## Factors Causing Low TRM

- New environment, content, or tasks
- Accelerated pace of the job
- Abrupt changes to the job itself

## Common Misconception

Do not confuse a manager's general competence and maturity with their task-relevant maturity. High general maturity does not guarantee high TRM in a new role.
