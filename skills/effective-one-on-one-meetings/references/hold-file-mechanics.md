# Hold File Mechanics

## Purpose

The hold file applies the production principle of **batching** to managerial work. It minimizes ad hoc interruptions by accumulating non-urgent issues for scheduled discussion.

## How It Works

1. **Both parties maintain a hold file**: Supervisor and subordinate each keep their own file
2. **Add items as they arise**: When a non-urgent issue comes up, add it to the hold file instead of interrupting
3. **Review during scheduled meetings**: Go through hold file items during the one-on-one
4. **Prioritize**: Discuss items in order of importance or urgency

## Benefits

- Reduces random interruptions throughout the week
- Allows for more thoughtful consideration of issues
- Ensures non-urgent items don't get forgotten
- Models disciplined time management for subordinates

## What Goes in the Hold File

- Questions that can wait
- Ideas for improvement
- Minor concerns or observations
- Non-critical administrative items
- Follow-up items from previous meetings

## What Does NOT Go in the Hold File

- Urgent crises
- Time-sensitive decisions
- Safety issues
- Customer-impacting problems
- Anything that "really can't wait"
