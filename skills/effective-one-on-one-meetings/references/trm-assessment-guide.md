# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) Assessment Guide

## Definition
Task-Relevant Maturity is a combination of:
- Degree of the subordinate's achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience **specific to the task**

## Key Principles

### TRM is Task-Specific
It is entirely possible for a person to have:
- High TRM in one job
- Low TRM in another

Even seasoned managers may have low TRM if the environment, content, and tasks are new to them.

### Factors Causing Low TRM
- New environment or job content
- Abrupt job changes
- Accelerated pace of work
- Novel technologies or processes

### Distinguish from General Competence
Do not confuse a manager's general competence and maturity with their task-relevant maturity. High general maturity does not guarantee high TRM in a new role.

## Dynamic Nature
TRM can change:
- Day by day
- Hour by hour

## Management Style Impact
As TRM increases, management style should progress from:
- Close supervision → Structured supervision → Supportive → Minimal supervision

This progression requires shared operational values and priorities between manager and subordinate.
