# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) Reference

## Definition

Task-Relevant Maturity is a combination of:
- Degree of achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience

## Key Characteristics

- **Task-Specific**: A person can have high TRM in one job and low TRM in another
- **Dynamic**: TRM can change day by day or hour by hour
- **Context-Dependent**: Even seasoned managers may have low TRM in new environments

## Factors Causing Low TRM

- New environment, content, or tasks
- Accelerated pace of work
- Abrupt job changes

## Common Misconception

Do not confuse general competence and maturity with task-relevant maturity. High general maturity does not guarantee high TRM in a new role.
