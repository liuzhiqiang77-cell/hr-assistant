# Performance Review: Special Situations

## When to Use
- A manager's organization performs poorly but the manager seems personally capable
- A subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing
- A subordinate is a high achiever and needs development guidance
- A manager's rating appears higher than their organization's performance warrants

## The Potential Trap Rule

### Core Principle
**The performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the rating accorded to his organization.**

### Assess Substance over Form
- Evaluate actual performance and real output
- Ignore "potential" defined as form (e.g., knowledge, handling oneself well, looking like a manager)

### Apply the Organization Cap
- Compare the manager's rating to the organization's rating
- If the business unit lost money, missed revenue forecasts, slipped schedules, or showed poor internal measures, the manager cannot receive a high rating
- Reject excuses that the organization failed but the manager is "outstanding"

### Prevent Negative Signaling
- Avoid signaling that "acting" like a manager is sufficient
- Reinforce that performing like a manager is the requirement

## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process

### Identify the Resistance Cycle
Track the subordinate's current stage:
1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others to avoid responsibility
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation

### Facilitate Progression
- **Ignore → Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
- **Deny → Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance
- **Blame Others → Assume Responsibility**: Guide the subordinate to take the "biggest step"—this is an emotional step where they realize "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
- **Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**: Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task and relatively easier (intellectual step)

### Evaluate Possible Outcomes
1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')
1. Assume the formal role of the supervisor endowed with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. Secure the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### Identify the Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying the judgment of superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better.

### Contrast with Poor Performers
- Poor performers often receive detailed "corrective action programs" (step-by-step affairs to meet minimum requirements)
- High achievers often lack future-oriented guidance

### Shift the Priority
Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to improve performance or maintain their current level.

### Rationale
High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a "high-leverage activity" where the impact on group output is very great.
