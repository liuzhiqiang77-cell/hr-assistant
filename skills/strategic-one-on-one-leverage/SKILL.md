# Strategic Leverage of One-on-One Meetings

## When to Use
- When you schedule a recurring one-on-one meeting with a subordinate
- When you need to upgrade your understanding of subordinate tasks
- When preparing to delegate effectively
- When you need to align strategic perspectives with direct reports

## Execution

### 1. Calculate Leverage Potential
Recognize that a small time investment (e.g., 1.5 hours) can enhance the quality of a subordinate's work for a significant duration (e.g., two weeks or 80+ hours). The meeting also upgrades the supervisor's understanding of the subordinate's domain.

### 2. Establish Common Base
Use the meeting to develop:
- A "common base of information" between supervisor and subordinate
- "Similar ways of doing and handling things"
- The foundation necessary for efficient and effective delegation

### 3. Facilitate Reverse Teaching
Allow the subordinate to teach you specific details and data that you may only be vaguely familiar with. This information is "absolutely essential" for making good decisions.

### 4. Joint Data Analysis
Review specific indicators (e.g., trend indicators of incoming orders) together. Ponder the data and consider their relationship to:
- Other industry indicators
- Temporary anomalies (e.g., seasonal slowness)
- Actual business trends (e.g., business stopped growing)

### 5. Formulate Congruent Conclusions
Develop a "congruent attitude, approach, and conclusion" based on shared analysis. Example: Deciding to take a "conservative approach to near-term investment" rather than assuming growth.

### 6. Execute Cascading Actions
- **Subordinate**: Implements decisions in their specific area of responsibility
- **Supervisor**: Shares conclusions with other business groups or managers, multiplying the leverage across the organization

## Constraints
- Requires willingness to share information openly
- Requires time investment from supervisor
- Requires regular scheduled meeting time (e.g., every two weeks)
