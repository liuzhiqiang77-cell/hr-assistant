description: Use this skill when delegating tasks to subordinates and monitoring their progress. It covers establishing shared operational values as a prerequisite, assessing Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) to determine appropriate supervision level, selecting tasks to delegate, and implementing quality assurance monitoring without meddling. Apply when you need to free up time, develop subordinates, or ensure delegated work meets expectations.

# Delegation and Monitoring Workflow

Effective delegation requires shared values, appropriate task selection based on maturity, and monitoring that ensures quality without becoming micromanagement.

## When to Use

- Freeing up manager time for higher-leverage activities
- Developing subordinate capabilities
- Assigning work that matches subordinate maturity level
- Ensuring delegated work meets expectations

## Establish Prerequisites

### Shared Operational Values

Before delegating, ensure commonality of operational values, priorities, and preferences:

1. **Establish Commonality**: Shared understanding of how the organization works together is essential for delegation.
2. **Internalize Structure**: As TRM grows, structure moves from externally imposed to internally adopted.
3. **Supervisor Teaching Duty**: The responsibility for transmitting values rests with the supervisor.
4. **Prevent Customer Tuition**: Do not allow subordinates to learn through customer-impacting mistakes. Teach correct values early.
5. **Accountability**: Since the supervisor is accountable for output, delegation requires shared values.

### Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

TRM is specific to the task, not general competence:

1. **Definition**: Combination of achievement orientation, readiness for responsibility, education, training, and experience.
2. **Assess Specificity**: A person can have high TRM in one job and low in another.
3. **Identify Low TRM Causes**: New environment, content, tasks, accelerated pace, or abrupt job changes.
4. **Distinguish from General Competence**: High general maturity does not guarantee high TRM in a new role.

## Delegate Tasks

Follow these delegation rules:

1. **Prerequisite Check**: Ensure delegator and delegatee share a common information base and operational ideas.
2. **Avoid Insincere Delegation**: Do not emotionally hold onto tasks while pretending to delegate.
3. **Task Selection**: Delegate activities familiar to you rather than unfamiliar ones—easier to monitor.
4. **Responsibility Principle**: "Delegation without follow-through is abdication." You remain responsible for the outcome.

## Monitor Delegated Tasks

Apply quality assurance monitoring principles:

1. **Timing**: Monitor at the lowest-added-value stage (e.g., review rough drafts, not final polished versions).
2. **Sampling**: Do not check 100% of details. Check randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress.
3. **Frequency Based on TRM**:
   - Increase monitoring for newly delegated tasks
   - Decrease intensity as subordinate's work improves
   - Adjust based on specific task maturity, not general ability

## Avoid Meddling

Monitoring ensures the activity proceeds in line with expectations. Meddling is prescribing specific activities. Focus on outcomes and quality, not methods.
