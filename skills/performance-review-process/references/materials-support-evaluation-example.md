- Manage manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Production Planning Performance

- Voluntary utilization of prior background (e.g., finance helping Purchasing)

## Promotion Eligibility

**Current Status**: Promotion to next management level denied if criteria not met

**Required Capabilities:**
- Can take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system) and show results
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of method to achieve goals

**Independence Requirement:**
