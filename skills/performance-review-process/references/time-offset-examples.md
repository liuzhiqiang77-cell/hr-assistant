# Time Offset Assessment Examples

## Example 1: R&D Project

**Situation**: Scientist spent entire review period on basic research with no publications or patents.

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Current output: None visible
- Activities: High-quality research, building knowledge base
- Expected payoff: 2-3 years in future

**Present Value Calculation**:
- If research leads to 3 patents worth $10M each over 10 years
- Future value: $30M
- Discount rate: 10%
- Present value: ~$11.4M

**Performance Rating**: Above average—building future capacity

## Example 2: Manufacturing Setup

**Situation**: Manager spent year setting up new production facility. No units produced.

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Current output: Zero units
- Activities: Facility construction, equipment installation, team hiring
- Expected payoff: Facility operational next year

**Present Value Calculation**:
- Expected annual production: $50M
- Facility lifespan: 10 years
- Future value: $500M
- Present value (10% discount): ~$193M

**Performance Rating**: Exceeds requirements—significant future value created

## Example 3: Sales Training Initiative

**Situation**: Sales director implemented new training program. Sales flat during period.

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Current output: Same as previous year
- Activities: Training design, delivery, team skill development
- Expected payoff: 15% sales increase starting next quarter

**Present Value Calculation**:
- Current annual sales: $20M
- Expected increase: $3M/year
- 5-year benefit: $15M
- Present value: ~$11.4M

**Performance Rating**: Meets requirements—good investment, payoff pending

## Example 4: Maintenance vs Production

**Situation**: Production manager shut down line for major maintenance. Output decreased 20%.

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Current output: Decreased due to downtime
- Activities: Preventive maintenance, equipment upgrades
- Expected payoff: 5% efficiency increase, reduced breakdowns

**Present Value Calculation**:
- Annual production value: $100M
- Efficiency gain: $5M/year
- Reduced breakdown costs: $2M/year
- 5-year benefit: $35M
- Present value: ~$21.8M

**Performance Rating**: Exceeds requirements—short-term pain for long-term gain
