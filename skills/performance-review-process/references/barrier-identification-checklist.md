# Communication Barrier Identification Checklist

## During Delivery, Watch For:

### Barrier: Too Emotional to Understand
**Signs:**
- [ ] Eyes welling up or visible tears
- [ ] Face flushed or pale
- [ ] Hands shaking
- [ ] Voice cracks or trembles
- [ ] Rapid, shallow breathing

### Barrier: Formulating Answers Instead of Listening
**Signs:**
- [ ] Looking away while you're still speaking
- [ ] Subtle nodding but unfocused eyes
- [ ] Pen already writing before you finish
- [ ] Body turned away, leaning toward exit
- [ ] Starting sentences before you complete your thought

### Barrier: Tuned Out (Defense Mechanism)
**Signs:**
- [ ] Blank stare, "thousand-yard" look
- [ ] Checking phone or watch repeatedly
- [ ] Physical withdrawal (slumping, crossing arms tightly)
- [ ] No eye contact at all
- [ ] Monosyllabic responses ("uh-huh," "okay")
- [ ] Fidgeting excessively

## Verification Techniques

### Verbal Verification
- Ask: "Can you tell me what you heard me say about [specific topic]?"
- Ask: "Does that make sense?"
- Ask: "What questions do you have about what I just said?"

### Nonverbal Verification
- Watch for: Nodding at appropriate times
- Watch for: Leaning in when important points are made
- Watch for: Taking notes if they normally do
- Watch for: Eye contact that indicates engagement

### If Barriers Are Present
1. **Stop and acknowledge:** "I can see this is difficult to hear."
2. **Allow processing:** "Take a moment if you need to."
3. **Simplify:** "Let me put this another way."
4. **Check again:** "Now, what's your understanding of this point?"
5. **Persist:** Continue until you are satisfied the message was received

## When to Continue vs. Reschedule

### Continue
- Minor emotional reaction
- Temporary distraction
- Momentary confusion

### Consider Rescheduling
- Strong, ongoing emotional reaction
- Complete inability to engage
- Crisis situation unrelated to review
- Multiple barriers present simultaneously

**Note:** Rescheduling is not avoiding difficult conversations—it's ensuring the message can be received when the subordinate is capable of hearing it.
