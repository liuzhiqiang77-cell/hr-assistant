- Missed project deadline on March 15
- Turned in Q1 report two days early
- Responds to emails within 24 hours consistently
- Had to remind about weekly status updates three times

### Relationship Analysis
Pattern: Administrative follow-through issues with deadlines, but strong on routine communication responsiveness

### Formulated Message
"You have strong follow-through on routine communication tasks like email responses and even turned in your quarterly report early. However, you struggle with deadlines that require proactive scheduling and calendar management—specifically, staff meeting attendance and the March project deadline."

### Supporting Examples

## Example 2: Team Collaboration

### Worksheet Items (Raw Data)
- Other team members complain about tone in meetings
- Wrote excellent documentation that helped the whole team
- Interrupts colleagues frequently
- Volunteers for extra work when team is overloaded
- Doesn't share information on customer account status
- Great at explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical team members

### Relationship Analysis
Pattern: Strong individual contributor and teacher, but poor awareness of how behavior affects team dynamics

### Formulated Message
"You're a valued knowledge resource for the team—your documentation is excellent and you have a gift for explaining technical concepts. However, your meeting behavior is undermining your contributions. You interrupt colleagues and others have raised concerns about your tone. Additionally, keeping account information to yourself creates bottlenecks for the team."

### Supporting Examples
- Strengths: Excellent documentation, volunteers for extra work, explains technical concepts well
- Issues: Interrupts colleagues frequently, tone concerns raised by team, doesn't share account status

## Example 3: The Surprise Message

### Worksheet Items (Raw Data)
- [Multiple positive items about performance]
- Customer X mentioned feeling "dismissed" in a call last week

### Relationship Analysis
This isolated comment seems like an anomaly—but if true, it could be a serious issue that needs addressing before it damages the relationship.

### Formulated Message (After "Swallowing Hard")
"I have to bring up something difficult. In reviewing notes from last week, a customer mentioned they felt dismissed during your call with them. This is very unlike the professional relationship-builder I've seen you be with other clients. Can you tell me what happened in that conversation?"

### Supporting Example
- Customer X feedback from last week's call log

**Note:** Even if this feels like a minor point, if the pattern is real and unaddressed, it could escalate to losing the customer. Better to address now than wait for it to become a bigger problem.
