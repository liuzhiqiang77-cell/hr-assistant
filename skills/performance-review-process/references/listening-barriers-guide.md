# Listening Barriers During Performance Reviews

## Common Nonverbar Signs of Barriers

| Barrier Type | What to Look For | What It Means |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Emotional Overload** | Teary eyes, flushed face, tense posture | Cannot process information right now |
| **Formulating Response** | Blank stare, rapid nodding, interrupting | Not actually listening, preparing rebuttal |
| **Tuning Out** | Distant gaze, lack of eye contact, fidgeting | Psychological defense; not receiving message |
| **Aggressive Body Language** | Crossed arms, leaned back, hostile expression | Preparing for fight, not dialogue |

## Intervention Strategies

### For Emotional Overload
1. Pause the review
2. "I can see this is difficult to hear. Let's take a break."
3. Resume only when they're ready

### For Response-Formulation
1. Stop speaking mid-sentence if needed
2. "You don't need to respond right now. Just listen." 
3. "I want to make sure you understand this before we discuss it."

### For Tuning Out
1. Re-establish eye contact gently
2. "Let me say this another way."
3. Check for understanding: "Can you tell me what you heard me say?"

### For Aggressive Body Language
1. Acknowledge the tension: "This is hard to hear."
2. Return to facts, not judgments
3. Separate behavior from person

## Verification Checklist

Before moving to next point, confirm:
- [ ] Subordinate is making eye contact
- [ ] Facial expressions match the message (concern for bad news, engagement for discussion)
- [ ] Verbal responses indicate understanding (not just agreement)
- [ ] Body is open and oriented toward reviewer
- [ ] No defensive behaviors present

If any check fails, pause and clarify before proceeding.
