# Materials Support Supervisor Performance Evaluation Example

This is a detailed evaluation framework for a Materials Support Supervisor transitioning from finance to manufacturing.

## Core Responsibilities

Managing:
- Production planning process
- Manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

## Evaluation Criteria

### Production Planning Performance

**Positive Indicators**:
- Significant process changes during review period
- Well-coordinated sites
- Efficient administrative activity

**Rating**: "Good" if sites are well coordinated and activities are efficiently done.

### Manufacturing Specifications Performance

**Goal Setting Assessment**:

*Negative Indicators*:
- Difficulty setting objectives and key results
- "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews
- Lack of definitive statement on system direction

*Consequence*: Falling into the trap of "working on" things without reaching objectives.

**Meeting Effectiveness Assessment**:

*Negative Indicator*: Satisfaction that having a meeting on a subject constitutes progress.

*Corrective Action*: Employee must define specific results to accomplish **prior** to each meeting.

### Strengths & Background Utilization

- Speed of learning (getting up to speed quickly)
- Utilization of prior background (e.g., finance) to assist other areas voluntarily

## Promotion Eligibility

**Current Status**: Promotion to next management level is denied if specific criteria are not met.

**Required Capabilities**:
- Ability to take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system) and show results
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of the way to achieve those goals

**Independence Requirement**: Employee must be the "primary driver"; supervisor helps only when needed.

## Final Rating Determination

**Meets Requirements**: Assigned if capable of doing current job, but acknowledging specific areas (goal setting, defining ways of accomplishing tasks) need improvement.

**Context Adjustment**: Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance.
