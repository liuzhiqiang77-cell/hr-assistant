# Compensation and Career Development

## Middle Manager Compensation System Design

Use when designing or reviewing compensation structures for middle or senior managers.

### Constraints

- Do not pay out lavishly if the company is going bankrupt
- Finite money requires allocation choices
- Performance is hard to assess precisely for middle managers (not paid by piece, woven into team)

### Design Performance Bonus (Variable Pay)

#### Determine Bonus Percentage

| Manager Level | Bonus Range | Reasoning |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Middle Manager | 10% to 25% of total compensation | Higher earners have less material utility for incremental dollars |
| Senior Manager | Up to 50% of total compensation | Higher percentage needed for feedback while avoiding hardship from fluctuations |

#### Define Bonus Factors (Scope)

1. Identify if performance is Team-based or Individual-based.
2. If Team-based, define the team (Project team, Division, or Entire Corporation).
3. **Recommended 3-Factor Split** (e.g., for 20% total comp):
   - Individual Performance (judged by supervisor)
   - Immediate Team Objective Performance (e.g., department)
   - Overall Corporate Financial Performance

#### Establish Timing

- Pay bonus close enough to the work time so the subordinate remembers why it was awarded.
- Account for cause/effect time offsets.

#### Select Metrics

- Options: Countable items (financial), Measurable objectives, or Subjective elements
- **Caution**: Subjective elements may lead to a "beauty contest."

### Design Salary Administration (Base Pay)

#### Select Administration Scheme

| Option | Description | Pros/Cons |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| A: Experience-Only | Pay based strictly on time | Easiest, but ignores merit |
| B: Merit-Only | Pay based on performance only | Impractical, hard to ignore experience |
| C: Compromise (Recommended) | "Family of curves" | Starts everyone at same level, different speeds/variance based on performance |

#### Implement Competitive Ranking (Required for Merit)

- Accept that merit-based systems require competitive, comparative evaluation.
- **Principle**: If someone is first, someone else must be last (similar to sports rankings).

## Promotion Performance Cycle

Use when managing employee career progression.

### The Promotion Cycle Logic

1. **Initial State**: Employee at Job 1 performing at "meets requirements" (average level).
2. **Improvement Phase**: With training and motivation, performance improves to "exceeds requirements" (above-average).
3. **Promotion Trigger**: Employee "exceeds requirements" and is considered "promotable." Promote to Job 2.
4. **Performance Reset**: Upon entering Job 2, employee initially performs at "meets requirements" due to new challenges.
5. **Cycle Repetition**: With experience in Job 2, employee improves to "exceeds requirements" → another promotion.
6. **Cycle Conclusion**: Cycle repeats until employee settles at "meets requirements" and is no longer promoted (reaching "level of incompetence" / Peter Principle).

### Critical Constraint

**If an employee "exceeds the requirements" but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will "atrophy" and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements.**

### Promotion Evaluation

- **IF** employee performance rating = "exceeds requirements" → Evaluate for promotion
- **IF** employee performance rating = "meets requirements" → Maintain current level
- Does not apply to "noncompetitors" who have no motivation to do more

## Employee Recycling Procedure

Use when a promoted employee performs below-average for an extended period.

### Process Steps

1. **Identification**: Recognize that a person has been promoted "so much over their head" that they perform below-average for an extended time.
2. **Solution Selection**: Choose to "recycle" the employee rather than terminate them.
3. **Definition**: Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion.
4. **Management Accountability**: Management must admit it was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness."
5. **Implementation**: Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do.
6. **Support System**: Support the employee in the face of likely "embarrassment."
7. **Transparency**: Execute the recycling "openly" to reduce stigma.

### Expected Outcome and Future Value

- Embarrassment will be "short-lived"
- Employee will regain confidence
- Once confidence is regained, the employee becomes an "excellent candidate for another promotion" at a later time and is likely to succeed

### Prohibited Action

**Do NOT** force the employee to leave the company. Reject the rationalization that "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake."

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing compensation packages for new managers
- Reviewing existing compensation structures
- Evaluating employees for promotion
- Managing over-promoted employees
- Creating career development programs
