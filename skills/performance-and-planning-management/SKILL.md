description: Diagnoses employee performance issues and guides resource allocation in product planning. Use when an employee is underperforming, planning product development, or deciding where to invest energy in a project lifecycle. Critical for managers and project leaders.

# Performance and Planning Management

## When to Use This Skill
- An employee is not performing their job duties
- Diagnosing root causes of underperformance
- Planning a product or project lifecycle
- Deciding where to allocate resources and energy
- Identifying gaps in current output

## Employee Performance Diagnosis

### When to Apply
- Observation of underperformance
- Role and expectations are clearly defined

### Diagnosis Framework

When an employee is not doing their job, determine the root cause by categorizing into one of two buckets:

#### Category 1: Can't Do It (Capability Issue)
- The employee lacks the capability, skill, or knowledge
- **Intervention**: Train the employee

#### Category 2: Won't Do It (Motivation Issue)
- The employee lacks the motivation, will, or drive
- **Intervention**: Motivate the employee

### Critical Constraint
There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train.

### Decision Process
1. Identify that the employee is not performing
2. Determine: Is it "Can't" or "Won't"?
3. If Can't → Provide training
4. If Won't → Provide motivation

## Product Planning Energy Principle

### When to Apply
- Planning a product or project
- Identifying a gap in current output
- Managing complex systems where gaps represent planning failures

### Core Principle

**Today's Gap**: Any gap identified today represents a failure of planning sometime in the past.

### Energy Allocation Strategy

| Timing | Energy Investment | ROI Multiplier |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Early in process | Maximum energy at the beginning | +10x (tenfold return) |
| End of program | Minimal energy at the end | -10x (negative tenfold return) |

### Strategic Implications

1. **Invest Early**: Put maximum energy at the beginning of the process
   - Focus on prevention and early design
   - Energy invested early pays off tenfold

2. **Avoid Late Fixes**: Do not rely on fixing issues at the end
   - Last-minute fixes cost ten times more
   - Energy put in at the end has negative ROI

3. **Resource Allocation**: Guide efforts toward early phases of a project
   - Prevention > Cure
   - Design > Fixes

### Application Examples
- Product development: Invest in requirements and design, not testing at the end
- Process improvement: Fix root causes early, not symptoms later
- Strategic planning: Thorough upfront analysis prevents costly course corrections
