# Performance Indicators and Monitoring

## When to Use This Skill
- Starting daily operations or arriving at office
- Designing or selecting performance metrics
- Monitoring progress toward deadlines or monthly goals
- Analyzing workflow mechanics and predicting future output
- Establishing administrative performance standards
- Preventing over-optimization of single metrics

## Daily Operational Indicator Set

Review these indicators daily to take immediate corrective action:

### 1. Sales Forecast
- Determine planned units for delivery today

### 2. Variance Analysis
- Compare yesterday's actual vs. planned deliveries
- Assess confidence in today's forecast

### 3. Raw Material Inventory
- Verify stock levels (eggs, bread, coffee)
- **If too low**: Order more supplies immediately
- **If too high**: Cancel scheduled deliveries

### 4. Equipment Condition
- Check for breakdowns from yesterday
- Arrange repairs or rearrange production line

### 5. Manpower
- Check staff availability (sick leave, etc.)
- **If understaffed**: Call temporary help or reallocate staff

### 6. Quality Indicator
- Review customer complaint log
- **If complaints exceed normal**: Speak to affected staff immediately

## Design Effective Indicators

### Attention Principle
Indicators direct attention like steering a bicycle—you steer where you look.

### Guard Against Overreaction
Focusing on a single metric can lead to extreme behaviors (e.g., driving inventory too low creates shortages).

### Implement Paired Indicators
Always pair indicators to measure both effect and counter-effect:
- **Inventory Levels** ↔ **Incidence of Shortages**
- **Completion Date** ↔ **Capability**
- **# Vouchers Processed** ↔ **# Errors Found**
- **Square Feet Cleaned** ↔ **Quality Rating**

### Administrative Indicator Criteria
1. **Any measurement is better than none**
2. **Measure Output (results), not Activity (effort)**
   - Measure: Orders obtained, not calls made
3. **Measure Physical/Countable things**
   - Examples: Vouchers processed, transactions processed, people hired

## Black Box Process Model

### Conceptualize the Process
Treat any workflow as a "black box" with three components:

1. **Input**: Raw materials, data, or applicants flowing in
2. **Labor**: Work performed by personnel flowing in
3. **Output**: Finished result flowing out

### Cut Windows into the Box
Establish indicators to observe internal operations and predict future output.

### Examples
- **Recruiting**: Input = applicants; Labor = interviewers; Output = hired graduates
- **Billing**: Input = purchase info; Labor = billing personnel; Output = final bill
- **Training**: Input = product specs; Labor = trainers; Output = trained sales staff

## Linearity Indicator Analysis

### Plot Progress
- Plot actual output achieved against time elapsed
- Define "Ideal Straight Line" from start to target

### Compare and Interpret
- **Below line**: Calculate required rate for remaining period; take corrective action
- **Back-loaded** (concentrated at end): Address resource allocation inefficiency

### Purpose
Provides early warning to allow corrective action before deadline passes.

## Output
A balanced set of metrics with paired indicators, daily review procedures, and progress monitoring that prevents over-optimization and enables proactive management.
