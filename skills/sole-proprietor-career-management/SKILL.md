**Ask:** "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"

**Action:**

### Question 2: Connectivity

**Ask:** "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"

**Check:**
- Include inside the company and the industry
- Do not wait for supervisor to interpret events
- Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people" rather than "floating by yourself"

### Question 3: Innovation

**Ask:** "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"

**Action:**
- Personally try new things; do not just read about them
- Do not wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of that workplace
