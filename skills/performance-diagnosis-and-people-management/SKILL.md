# Performance Diagnosis and People Management

## When to Use This Skill
- An employee is not performing their job duties
- Making promotion or hiring decisions
- Designing career progression systems
- Training new managers
- Defining management philosophy and culture

## Part 1: Employee Performance Diagnosis

### The Two-Category Framework

When an employee is not performing, determine the root cause by categorizing into one of two buckets:

| Category | Description | Solution |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Can't do it** | Employee lacks the capability | Train the employee |
| **Won't do it** | Employee lacks the motivation | Motivate the employee |

### Execution Steps

1. **Identify the performance gap**: Observe that the employee is not meeting expectations
2. **Diagnose the root cause**: Determine if it's a capability issue (can't) or motivation issue (won't)
3. **Apply the appropriate intervention**:
   - If Can't do: Provide training, coaching, or skill development
   - If Won't do: Apply motivational techniques, incentives, or address behavioral issues
4. **Monitor and adjust**: Track improvement and adjust approach as needed

### Critical Constraint
There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train. All other interventions fall into these two categories.

## Part 2: Avoiding the Peter Principle

### The Peter Principle Defined
"In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

### How It Occurs

1. **Selection criteria**: A candidate is selected for a position based on their performance in their current role
2. **Missing criteria**: Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"
3. **Trajectory**: The employee continues to be promoted until they reach a role they are not skilled for
4. **Outcome**: The employee stops being promoted once they are no longer competent, resulting in managers rising to the level of their incompetence

### Prevention Strategies

1. **Evaluate for the intended role**: Assess candidates based on competencies specific to the new position, not just current performance
2. **Identify skill gaps**: Determine if the skills required for the new role differ from current role skills
3. **Use trial periods**: Test capabilities in the new role before permanent promotion
4. **Provide development**: Bridge skill gaps before promotion when possible

## Part 3: Management as a Team Game

### Core Concept
Management is explicitly defined as a "Team Game."

### Operational Implications

1. **Success is collective**: Management success depends on collective effort rather than individual prowess
2. **Collaboration is central**: Coordination and teamwork are essential to the management function
3. **No lone heroes**: Individual brilliance without team engagement does not constitute effective management

### Application
- When defining management roles, emphasize team outcomes over individual achievements
- Design reward systems that recognize collective success
- Foster collaboration across organizational boundaries
- Train managers to build and enable high-performing teams
