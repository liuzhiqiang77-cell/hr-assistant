# Self-Actualization Driver Types

## Competence-Driven

**Focus**: Job or task mastery

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- Sharpening own skill continuously
- Trying to do better than the time before
- Focused on personal improvement benchmarks

**Examples**:
- A violinist practicing daily to perfect technique
- A teenager perfecting a skateboard trick
- A coder refactoring code for elegance

**Management Approach**:
- Provide opportunities for skill development
- Allow time for practice and experimentation
- Recognize mastery milestones

## Achievement-Driven

**Focus**: Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- Testing the limits of capability
- Working at the "boundary of their capability"
- Seeking challenges regardless of domain

### Behavioral Classification (Peg/Ring Experiment)

**Gamblers**:
- High risk
- No influence on outcome
- Motivated by thrill, not achievement

**Conservatives**:
- Very little risk
- Avoid failure at all costs
- Motivated by security

**Achievers**:
- Challenge themselves at the boundary of capability
- Accept 50% failure rate as acceptable
- Test limits to expand capability

**Management Approach**:
- Set goals at the edge of capability (50% success rate)
- Provide stretch assignments
- Frame failure as learning, not defeat
- Recognize effort and growth, not just success

## Commonality
Both types spontaneously try to test the outer limits of their abilities. The key difference is the domain focus (specific skill vs. general achievement).
