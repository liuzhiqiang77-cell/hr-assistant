- Clear metrics available
- Direct supervision possible

### Knowledge Workers
**Characteristics**:
- Output is difficult to measure immediately
- Expectations are hard to state precisely

## Competence-Driven vs Achievement-Driven

### Competence-Driven
**Focus**: Job or task mastery
- Sharpening own skill
- Trying to do better than the time before
- Continuous improvement in specific domain

**Examples**:
- Violinist practicing daily
- Craftsman perfecting technique
- Programmer optimizing code

**Management Approach**:
- Provide opportunities for skill development
- Enable mastery experiences
- Recognize incremental improvement

### Achievement-Driven
**Focus**: Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors
- Testing limits of capability
- Working at "boundary of capability"
- Pushing beyond current performance

**Behavioral Classification** (Peg/Ring Experiment):
- **Gamblers**: High risk, no influence on outcome
- **Conservatives**: Very little risk
- **Achievers**: Challenge themselves at boundary of capability

**Management Approach**:
- Set challenging but achievable goals
- Provide stretch assignments
- Recognize boundary-pushing behavior

**Commonality**: Both types spontaneously try to test outer limits of abilities
