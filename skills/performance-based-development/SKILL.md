# Performance-Based Development Strategies

## When to Use
- Conducting reviews for poor performers at risk of termination
- Developing high achievers to reach even higher performance
- An employee needs significant performance turnaround
- A top performer lacks future-oriented development guidance

## The 'Blast' Process for Poor Performers

### When to Apply
- Subordinate has a major performance problem
- Turnaround is required to avoid firing
- Performance is below acceptable standards

### Step 1: Identify Current Stage in Resistance Cycle

| Stage | Behavior | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1: Ignore | Passive ignoring | Pretends problem doesn't exist |
| 2: Deny | Active denial | Claims problem doesn't exist |
| 3: Blame Others | Deflection | Admits problem exists but blames others |
| 4: Assume Responsibility | Acceptance | Admits "It is my problem" |
| 5: Find Solution | Problem-solving | Works on remedy |

### Step 2: Facilitate Progression Through Stages

**From Ignore to Deny**:
- Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
- Present concrete evidence of performance issues

**From Deny to Blame Others**:
- Use evidence to overcome resistance
- Show data that cannot be disputed

**From Blame Others to Assume Responsibility** (The Critical Step):
- This is an **emotional step**, not intellectual
- Guide subordinate to realize: "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
- Acknowledge this implies work and unpleasantness
- This is the hardest step in the process

**From Assume Responsibility to Find Solution**:
- This is an **intellectual step** (easier than emotional step)
- Once responsibility is assumed, finding solutions becomes a shared task
- Collaborate on actionable remedies

### Step 3: Evaluate Possible Outcomes

| Outcome | Description | Next Steps |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure | Implement solution, monitor progress |
| 2 | Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure | Implement solution, monitor progress, revisit assessment later |
| 3 | Subordinate disagrees and does not commit | Execute fallback procedure |

### Step 4: Execute Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at "Blame Others")

1. **Assume formal supervisor role**: Exercise position power
2. **State instruction clearly**: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. **Acknowledge disagreement**: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. **Assert organizational requirement**: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. **Secure commitment**: Obtain explicit commitment to the course of action
6. **Monitor performance**: Track results against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### When to Apply
- Subordinate is identified as a high performer
- Review focuses only on past justification
- High achiever lacks future-oriented guidance

### Step 1: Analyze Current Review Content

Determine if the review is:
- **Retrospective assessment**: Analyzing what the subordinate did in the prior year
- **Justification of high rating**: Explaining why the rating is high
- **Developmental**: Focused on future improvement

### Step 2: Recognize the Common Pitfall

**Problem**: Supervisors often spend effort justifying superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better.

**Contrast with Poor Performers**:
- Poor performers receive detailed "corrective action programs"
- High achievers often lack future-oriented guidance

### Step 3: Shift Priority to Future Development

Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to:
- Improve performance beyond current level
- Maintain current high performance
- Develop new capabilities
- Prepare for increased responsibility

### Step 4: Leverage the High-Leverage Opportunity

**Key Insight**: High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work.

**Impact**: Improving high achievers is a "high-leverage activity" where the impact on group output is very great.

**Example**: A 10% improvement from a top performer who delivers 200% of expected output yields more organizational benefit than a 50% improvement from an average performer.
