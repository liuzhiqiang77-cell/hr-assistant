# 'Blast' Process Dialogue Examples

## Example 1: Moving from Blame Others to Responsibility

**Manager**: "I've reviewed the project data. We missed the deadline by 3 weeks."

**Employee (Stage 3)**: "That's because marketing didn't give us the requirements on time, and engineering kept changing the specs."

**Manager**: "I understand those challenges happened. Let me ask you: As the project lead, what could you have done differently to mitigate those issues?"

**Employee**: "Well, I guess I could have escalated the requirements delay earlier."

**Manager**: "And what about the spec changes?"

**Employee**: "I could have pushed back harder or frozen the specs sooner."

**Manager**: "So if we look at this project, what parts are within your control?"

**Employee**: "The timeline management, the escalation process, the spec freeze..."

**Manager**: "And what parts are outside your control?"

**Employee**: "Marketing's speed, engineering's decisions..."

**Manager**: "So what's the problem you can solve?"

**Employee (Stage 4)**: "I need to take ownership of the things I can control and manage them better."

**Manager**: "Exactly. What's your plan for the next project?"

**Employee (Stage 5)**: "I'll establish a spec freeze deadline, set up weekly checkpoints, and create an escalation matrix."

## Example 2: Fallback Procedure

**Manager**: "We need to discuss your sales performance. You're at 60% of quota with one month left."

**Employee (Stage 3)**: "The economy is terrible. No one is buying. Our competitors are undercutting us on price."

**Manager**: "I hear your concerns about market conditions. Let me show you the team data. The average rep is at 85% of quota in the same market."

**Employee**: "Well, they have better territories."

**Manager**: "Actually, your territory has above-average historical performance. Let me be direct. I understand you don't see it my way. You may be right or I may be right. But I am required by this organization to give you instructions. Here is what I want you to do:"

1. "Call your top 20 prospects every day for the next week"
2. "Use the new discount structure we discussed"
3. "Submit your call logs daily"

**Manager**: "Can you commit to this?"

**Employee**: "I still think it's the market, but yes, I'll do it."

**Manager**: "Good. Let's review your progress on Friday."

## High Achiever Development Example

**Manager**: "You've had an outstanding year. Exceeded all targets, led two major initiatives, mentored three new hires."

**Employee**: "Thanks! I'm glad it went well."

**Manager**: "I want to make sure we're not just celebrating the past. What are your goals for next year?"

**Employee**: "I'm not sure. Keep doing what I'm doing, I guess."

**Manager**: "You're delivering 150% of expected output. If we could get you to 170%, that would have a huge impact on the team. Here's what I'm thinking:"

1. "Take on the cross-functional integration project"
2. "Develop a training program for the new hires"
3. "Present at the industry conference"

**Manager**: "These would stretch your capabilities and increase your leverage. What do you think?"
