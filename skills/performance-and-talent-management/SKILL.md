# Performance and Talent Management

## When to Use
- Employee is not performing their job duties
- Making promotion or hiring decisions
- Employee is in a slow/no-growth environment
- Managing personal career development
- Addressing internal talent threats
- Conducting performance reviews

## Part 1: Employee Performance Diagnosis

### Step 1: Identify Performance Issue
- Observe that employee is not doing their job
- Document specific performance gaps
- Ensure role and expectations are clearly defined

### Step 2: Determine Root Cause

**Two Possible Causes**:

| Cause | Description | Indicator |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Can't do it | Lacks capability/skills | Training issue |
| Won't do it | Lacks motivation | Motivation issue |

### Step 3: Select Intervention

**If Can't do (Capability issue)**:
- Provide training
- Offer coaching/mentoring
- Adjust job requirements
- Consider reassignment

**If Won't do (Motivation issue)**:
- Provide motivation
- Address incentives
- Clarify consequences
- Consider performance improvement plan

**Key Constraint**: There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train.

## Part 2: The Peter Principle

### Understanding the Principle

**Definition**: "In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

**Mechanism**:
1. Selection based on performance in current role
2. Promotion continues while performance is good
3. Promotion stops when performance is inadequate
4. Employee remains at level of incompetence

### When It Applies
- Hierarchical promotion structure exists
- Selection based on past performance data
- Skills required for new role differ from current role

### When It Does NOT Apply
- Selection based on competencies specific to intended role
- Skills required for new role are identical to current role
- Promotion includes training for new responsibilities

### Mitigation Strategies

**For Promotion Decisions**:
- Evaluate candidates against intended role requirements
- Use competency-based assessment, not just current performance
- Consider trial periods in new roles
- Provide training before or during transition

**For Existing Managers**:
- Identify if someone has reached their level
- Provide lateral moves to leverage strengths
- Offer specialist tracks vs. management tracks
- Consider demotion or role redefinition

## Part 3: Sole Proprietor Career Management

### Step 1: Adopt the Mindset

**Core Beliefs**:
- You are not an employee; you are a business with one employee: yourself
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- Fellow workers are not primary rivals (outnumbered 1000:1 to 1,000,000:1 by global competitors)
- "Nobody owes you a career"; you own it as a sole proprietor

### Step 2: Execute Daily Career Management

**Continuous Actions**:
- Dedicate yourself to retaining individual competitive advantage
- Enhance your value every day
- Hone your competitive advantage
- Learn and adapt constantly
- Be willing to move from job to job or industry to industry
- Retrench if necessary to start again

**Goal**: Avoid becoming a casualty of globalization and the information revolution

### Step 3: Address Internal Threats

**Identify the Threat**:
- Ambitious junior employees seeking upward movement
- Your position blocks their advancement
- Slow/no-growth environment intensifies threat

**Boss's Dilemma**:
- Choice A: Retain you (doing good job but blocking others)
- Choice B: Promote the junior (fresh energy, unblocked progression)

**Take Responsibility**:
- Avoid being "in the way"
- Move up (seek promotion) or move on (find new opportunity)
- Don't wait to be forced out

### Step 4: Perform Self-Assessment

**Question 1: Value Addition**
- Ask: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"
- Action: Continually look for ways to make things truly better
- Principle: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization"
- Standard: Every hour should increase output or value of people you're responsible for

**Question 2: Connectivity**
- Ask: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"
- Check: Inside the company AND the industry
- Action: Don't wait for supervisor to interpret events
- Status: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people"

**Question 3: Innovation**
- Ask: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"
- Action: Personally try new things; don't just read about them
- Warning: Don't wait for others to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of it

### Step 5: Apply Productivity Principles

- Apply methods of production to your work
- Exercise managerial leverage in your role
- Elicit an athlete's desire for peak performance
- Treat your career as a business to be optimized

## Key Variables

- **Performance_Root_Cause**: Capability (Can't) or Motivation (Won't)
- **current_role_performance**: Candidate's success in existing position
- **intended_role_abilities**: Skills required for new position
- **Competitive_Landscape**: Global market of individuals capable of doing your work
- **Internal_Threat_Level**: Presence of ambitious junior employees
- **Manager_Output**: Output of organization unit for which manager is responsible
