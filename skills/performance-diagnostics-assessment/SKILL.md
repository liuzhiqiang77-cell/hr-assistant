name: Performance Diagnostics Assessment
description: Diagnose root causes of performance problems by distinguishing capability vs. motivation issues, apply the potential trap rule for managers, and evaluate performance considering time offsets between activities and results. Use when assessing underperforming individuals, evaluating manager performance, or when output lags behind work activities.

# Performance Diagnostics Assessment

## When to Use This Skill
- A subordinate, team member, or employee is not performing their job
- Evaluating a manager's performance rating
- Reviewing performance where tangible output does not align with activities performed
- Determining whether performance issues stem from capability or motivation

## Core Diagnostic Workflows

### 1. Capability vs. Motivation Diagnosis (The "Life or Death" Test)

**Purpose:** Determine if a performance issue is due to lack of capability (can't do it) or lack of motivation (won't do it).

**Procedure:**
1. Identify the specific performance issue: the person is not doing their job
2. Apply the diagnostic question: "If this person's life depended on doing the work, could they do it?"
3. Evaluate the answer:
   - **YES**: The person is capable but unmotivated → Use motivational strategies
   - **NO**: The person is incapable → Use training
4. Apply the appropriate intervention:
   - Capability issue: Training
   - Motivation issue: Motivation strategies

**Critical Principle:** These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job. Addressing other causes is ineffective unless the individual attempts to offer their best.

### 2. Manager Performance: The Potential Trap Rule

**Purpose:** Prevent inflating manager ratings based on "potential" rather than actual organizational performance.

**Procedure:**
1. Evaluate actual performance and real output
2. Ignore "potential" defined as form (knowledge, appearance, "looking like a manager")
3. Apply the organization cap:
   - **RULE**: Manager's performance rating cannot exceed the organization's rating
4. Enforce consequences:
   - If the business unit lost money, missed forecasts, slipped schedules, or showed poor internal measures, the manager cannot receive a high rating
   - Reject excuses that the organization failed but the manager is "outstanding"
5. Prevent negative signaling:
   - Avoid reinforcing that "acting" like a manager is sufficient
   - Require "performing" like a manager

**Anti-Pattern:** The "Potential Trap" - rating managers highly based on perceived potential despite poor organizational results.

### 3. Time Offset and Long-Term Assessment

**Purpose:** Properly credit performance when results lag behind activities (e.g., infrastructure, R&D, strategic initiatives).

**Procedure:**
1. Analyze the time offset between activities and visible output
2. Recognize that current output may reflect work done months or years ago ("light from distant stars")
3. Judge performance based on activities when tangible output is absent:
   - Give credit for strong activities even if immediate output is missing
   - Do not penalize for building future capacity
4. Weigh long-term vs. short-term impact:
   - Evaluate immediate outputs (meeting schedule, targets)
   - Against future-oriented activities (process improvements, new methods)
5. Apply present value concept:
   - Estimate future payoff of long-term activities
   - Determine what that future value is worth today

**Key Variables:**
- `time_offset`: Duration between activity and visible result
- `present_value`: Current worth of future-oriented activities

## Decision Summary

| Diagnostic Scenario | Key Question/Rule | Action Required |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Individual not performing | "Could they do it if their life depended on it?" | Training (NO) or Motivation (YES) |
| Manager rating proposed | Is Manager Rating ≤ Organization Rating? | Cap rating if NO |
| Results lag activities | Is output linked to current period activities? | Credit activities, apply present value |

## Constraints
- Does not apply if root cause is external (equipment failure, market conditions)
- Does not apply to purely administrative reviews without developmental intent
- Requires judgment beyond simple metrics for time offset analysis
