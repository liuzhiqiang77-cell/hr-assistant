# Time Offset Analysis Examples

## Common Time Offset Scenarios

### Research and Development
- **Activity**: Developing new technology or processes
- **Offset**: 1-3 years
- **Evaluation**: Credit for milestones, patents filed, prototypes completed
- **Present Value**: Discount projected future revenue based on probability of success

### Infrastructure Build-Out
- **Activity**: Setting up facilities, data centers, manufacturing lines
- **Offset**: 6-18 months
- **Evaluation**: Credit for on-time completion, under-budget, quality standards
- **Present Value**: Future cost savings, capacity increases

### Organizational Development
- **Activity**: Hiring, training, establishing processes
- **Offset**: 3-12 months
- **Evaluation**: Quality of hires, training completion, process adoption
- **Present Value**: Reduced turnover, increased productivity

## Present Value Estimation Framework

1. **Identify Future Benefit**: What will this activity produce and when?
2. **Quantify the Benefit**: Revenue, cost savings, efficiency gains
3. **Apply Discount Rate**: Typically 10-20% for internal projects
4. **Calculate Present Value**: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n
5. **Weigh Against Alternatives**: Is this the best use of current resources?

### Calculation Example

Activity: Implementing new manufacturing process
- Future annual savings: $500,000
- Implementation complete: 1 year from now
- Discount rate: 15%
- Years of benefit: 5 years

PV = $500,000 × (1 - (1.15)^-5) / 0.15 = $1,676,000

Decision: If implementation cost is under $1.68M, proceed.
