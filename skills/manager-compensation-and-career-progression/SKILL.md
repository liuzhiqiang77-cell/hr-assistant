# Manager Compensation and Career Progression

## When to Use
- Designing or reviewing a compensation structure for middle or senior managers
- Evaluating whether an employee should be promoted
- A promoted employee is performing below-average for an extended period

## Middle Manager Compensation System Design

### Step 1: Design Performance Bonus (Variable Pay)

**a. Determine Bonus Percentage**
- **Middle Manager**: Set bonus between 10% to 25% of total compensation
- **Senior Manager**: Set bonus up to 50% of total compensation
- **Reasoning**: Higher earners have less material utility for incremental dollars; higher percentage needed for feedback while avoiding hardship from fluctuations

**b. Define Bonus Factors**
- Identify if performance is Team-based or Individual-based
- If Team-based, define the team (Project team, Division, or Entire Corporation)
- **Recommended 3-Factor Split** (e.g., splitting 20% total comp):
  1. Individual Performance (judged by supervisor)
  2. Immediate Team Objective Performance (e.g., department)
  3. Overall Corporate Financial Performance

**c. Establish Timing**
- Pay bonus close enough to the work time so the subordinate remembers why it was awarded
- Account for cause/effect time offsets

**d. Select Metrics**
- Options: Countable items (financial), Measurable objectives, or Subjective elements
- Caution: Subjective elements may lead to a "beauty contest"

### Step 2: Design Salary Administration (Base Pay)

**a. Select Administration Scheme**
- **Option A: Experience-Only (Easiest)**: Pay based strictly on time. Ignores merit.
- **Option B: Merit-Only (Impractical)**: Hard to ignore experience.
- **Option C: Compromise (Recommended)**: "Family of curves"
  - Starts everyone at same salary level
  - Individuals move up at different speeds/arrive at different places based on performance
  - Shape approximates experience-only curve but allows variance

**b. Implement Competitive Ranking (Required for Merit)**
- Accept that merit-based systems require competitive, comparative evaluation
- Principle: If someone is first, someone else must be last (similar to sports rankings)

## Promotion Performance Cycle Logic

### Step 1: Initial State
Employee starts at Job 1 performing at an "average" level ("meets the requirements").

### Step 2: Improvement Phase
With training and motivation, employee improves to "above-average" ("exceeds the requirements").

### Step 3: Promotion Trigger
Once the employee "exceeds the requirements," they are considered "promotable" and are promoted to Job 2.

### Step 4: Performance Reset
Upon entering Job 2, the employee initially performs only at a "meets requirements" level due to new challenges.

### Step 5: Cycle Repetition
With experience in Job 2, the employee again improves to "exceeds requirements," leading to another promotion.

### Step 6: Cycle Conclusion
The cycle repeats until the employee settles at a "meets requirements" level and is no longer promoted (reaching their "level of incompetence").

### Critical Constraint
If an employee "exceeds the requirements" but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will "atrophy" and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements."

## Employee Recycling Procedure

### When to Use
- Employee has been promoted
- Employee is performing below-average for extended period

### Step 1: Identification
Recognize that a person has been promoted into a position "so much over his head" that they perform below-average for an extended time.

### Step 2: Solution Selection
Choose to "recycle" the employee rather than terminate them.

### Step 3: Definition of Recycling
Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion.

### Step 4: Management Accountability
Management must admit it was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness" for more responsibility.

### Step 5: Implementation
Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do.

### Step 6: Support System
Support the employee in the face of likely "embarrassment."

### Step 7: Transparency
Execute the recycling "openly" to reduce stigma.

### Step 8: Expected Outcome
- Embarrassment will be "short-lived"
- Employee will regain confidence
- Once confidence is regained, the employee becomes an "excellent candidate for another promotion" at a later time

### Prohibited Action
Do NOT force the employee to leave the company (reject the rationalization that "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake").

## Constraints
- Do not pay out lavishly if the company is going bankrupt
- Finite money resource requires allocation choices
- Performance is hard to assess precisely for middle managers (not paid by piece, woven into team)
- Does not apply to "noncompetitors" who have no motivation to do more
- Societal stigma regarding demotion
- Management tendency to view recycling as personal failure
