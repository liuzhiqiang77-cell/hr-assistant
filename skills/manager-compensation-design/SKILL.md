# Manager Compensation Design

## When to Use
Apply this system when:
- Designing or reviewing compensation structures for middle or senior managers
- Creating performance-based incentive programs
- Balancing individual and team-based rewards

## Design Performance Bonus (Variable Pay)

### 1. Determine Bonus Percentage based on Total Compensation
- **Middle Manager**: Set bonus between **10% to 25%** of total compensation
- **Senior Manager**: Set bonus **up to 50%** of total compensation

**Rationale**: Higher earners have less material utility for incremental dollars; higher percentage needed for feedback while avoiding hardship from fluctuations.

### 2. Define Bonus Factors (Scope)
Identify if performance is Team-based or Individual-based, then define the team:
- Project team
- Division
- Entire Corporation

**Recommended 3-Factor Split** (e.g., for 20% total comp):
1. Individual Performance (judged by supervisor)
2. Immediate Team Objective Performance (e.g., department)
3. Overall Corporate Financial Performance

### 3. Establish Timing
- Pay bonus close enough to the work time so the subordinate remembers why it was awarded
- Account for cause/effect time offsets

### 4. Select Metrics
Options:
- Countable items (financial)
- Measurable objectives
- Subjective elements (Caution: May lead to a "beauty contest")

## Design Salary Administration (Base Pay)

### 1. Select Administration Scheme

**Option A: Experience-Only** (Easiest)
- Pay based strictly on time (X time = Y pay)
- Ignores merit

**Option B: Merit-Only** (Impractical)
- Hard to ignore experience

**Option C: Compromise** (Recommended - "Family of curves")
- Starts everyone at same salary level
- Individuals move up at different speeds/arrive at different places based on performance
- Shape approximates experience-only curve but allows variance

### 2. Implement Competitive Ranking (Required for Merit)
- Accept that merit-based systems require competitive, comparative evaluation
- **Principle**: If someone is first, someone else must be last (similar to sports rankings)

## Constraints
- Do not pay out lavishly if the company is going bankrupt
- Finite money resource requires allocation choices
- Performance is hard to assess precisely for middle managers (not paid by piece, woven into team)
