# Compensation Design Examples

## Bonus Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Middle Manager - 3-Factor Split

**Profile**:
- Total Compensation: $150,000
- Bonus Target: 20% ($30,000)

**Bonus Factors**:
- Individual Performance (40%): $12,000
- Team Performance (40%): $12,000
- Corporate Performance (20%): $6,000

**Actual Payout**:
- Individual rating: "Exceeds" (120% of target) = $14,400
- Team objective: 95% achieved = $11,400
- Corporate result: 110% of target = $6,600
- **Total Bonus**: $32,400 (108% of target)

### Example 2: Senior Manager - Higher Risk Profile

**Profile**:
- Total Compensation: $400,000
- Bonus Target: 40% ($160,000)

**Bonus Factors**:
- Individual Performance (30%): $48,000
- Division Performance (50%): $80,000
- Corporate Performance (20%): $32,000

**Actual Payout (Poor Year)**:
- Individual rating: "Meets" (100% of target) = $48,000
- Division objective: 70% achieved = $56,000
- Corporate result: 80% of target = $25,600
- **Total Bonus**: $129,600 (81% of target)

**Impact**: Senior manager receives $30,400 less than target, but base salary remains stable.

## Salary Administration Examples

### Family of Curves Implementation

**Starting Point**: All new hires at Level start at $80,000

**Performance Trajectories over 5 Years**:

| Years | High Performer | Average Performer | Low Performer |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 0 | $80,000 | $80,000 | $80,000 |

| 2 | $98,000 | $89,000 | $84,500 |
| 3 | $110,000 | $95,000 | $87,000 |
| 4 | $125,000 | $102,000 | $89,500 |
| 5 | $142,000 | $110,000 | $92,000 |

**Analysis**:
- High performer: 78% increase over 5 years
- Average performer: 38% increase over 5 years

# Metric Selection Guide

## Countable Items (Financial Metrics)

**Pros**:
- Objective and measurable
- Easy to communicate
- Direct business impact

**Cons**:
- May encourage short-term thinking
- Can be gamed
- May not capture all value contributions

**Examples**:
- Revenue growth
- Profit margin improvement
- Cost reduction achieved
- Budget variance
- ROI on projects

## Measurable Objectives (KPIs)

**Pros**:
- Aligns with strategic goals
- Can be tailored to role
- Balances multiple priorities
n
**Cons**:
- Requires clear definition
- May be subjective in interpretation
- Can conflict with each other

**Examples**:
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Employee engagement scores
- Project completion on time/on budget
- Quality metrics (defect rates)
- Innovation metrics (patents filed, new products)

## Subjective Elements

**Pros**:
- Captures difficult-to-measure contributions
- Encourages desired behaviors
- Flexible to unique situations

**Cons**:
- Risk of bias
- Hard to defend
- Can create perception of unfairness

**Examples**:
- Leadership effectiveness
- Collaboration and teamwork
- Mentoring and development of others
- Innovation and creativity
- Cultural alignment

**Best Practices for Subjective Metrics**:
1. Define clear behavioral indicators
2. Use multiple raters (360-degree feedback)
3. Calibrate across managers to ensure consistency
4. Document specific examples
5. Limit subjective portion to 20-30% of total bonus

# Common Pitfalls and Solutions

## Pitfall 1: Bonus Too Small to Matter

**Problem**: 5% bonus doesn't motivate behavior change

**Solution**:
- Increase bonus percentage to meaningful level (10%+)
- Or, use non-monetary recognition for small achievements

## Pitfall 2: Metrics Too Complex

**Problem**: 15 different metrics confuse employees and dilute focus

**Solution**:
- Limit to 3-5 key metrics
- Ensure metrics are aligned (not conflicting)
- Weight metrics clearly

## Pitfall 3: Gaming the System

**Problem**: Employees manipulate metrics rather than improving performance

**Solution**:
- Use balanced scorecard approach
- Include qualitative assessments
- Monitor for unusual patterns
- Adjust metrics if gaming detected

## Pitfall 4: Unintended Consequences

**Problem**: Cost-cutting metric leads to quality problems

**Solution**:
- Consider second-order effects
- Use counter-balancing metrics
- Review outcomes regularly
- Adjust metrics as needed

## Pitfall 5: Inconsistent Application

**Problem**: Different managers apply different standards

**Solution**:
- Develop clear evaluation guidelines
- Conduct calibration sessions
- Train managers on assessment
- Audit for consistency
