description: Use this skill when implementing training programs for subordinates or teaching for the first time. Apply when you need to identify training needs, design and deliver courses, gather feedback, and manage the psychological aspects of being a first-time instructor. This skill covers both the implementation process and the mindset required for effective teaching.

# Subordinate Training Program Implementation

## When to Use
- Manager decides to implement a training program for subordinates
- First-time instructor preparing to teach or train others
- Subject matter expert assigned to teach their domain
- Need to develop subordinate capabilities systematically

## Part 1: Training Implementation Process

### 1. Identify Training Needs
- Create a list of topics subordinates should be trained in
- Do NOT limit the scope; include:
  - Simple tasks (e.g., taking calls)
  - Broad concepts (e.g., objectives, value systems)
- Ask subordinates what they feel they need to uncover unknown needs

### 2. Resource Inventory and Prioritization
- Take inventory of available manager-teachers and instructional materials
- Assign priorities to the items on the training list

### 3. Initial Course Design
- Start unambitiously with one short course (three to four lectures)
- Focus on the most urgent subject
- Be aware that explaining skills you possess is harder than practicing them
- Avoid the temptation to provide excessive background information that obscures the course objective

### 4. Preparation and Launch
- Set a schedule with deadlines to prevent getting bogged down
- Create an outline for the whole course
- Develop only the first lecture and begin teaching

### 5. Iterative Development
- Develop the second lecture only after delivering the first
- Regard the first delivery as a 'throwaway'; accept it will be unsatisfactory
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Teach the first version to knowledgeable subordinates who can provide interaction and critique without confusion

### 6. Scalability Assessment
- Determine if you can teach all members personally
- If many repetitions are needed (e.g., ten or twenty courses), use train-the-trainer model
- Use the first set of lectures to train a few instructors

### 7. Feedback and Evaluation
- After the course, request anonymous critiques from employees
- Use a form prompting for:
  - Numerical ratings
  - Open-ended questions
- Expect mixed feedback (too detailed, too superficial, just right in equal balance)
- Aim to satisfy yourself that objectives are met, rather than trying to please everyone

## Part 2: First-Time Teaching Mindset

### Acknowledge Difficulty and Depth Requirement
- Teaching is "hard work" involving lecture preparation and handling unpredictable questions
- Expect to discover knowledge gaps
- **Key Principle**: "Much deeper knowledge of a task is required to teach that task than simply to do it."
- **Analogy**: Consider the difficulty of "explaining to someone over the phone how to drive a stick-shift car."
- Do NOT be discouraged by this discovery; it is "typical."

### Recognize Personal Learning Benefit
- **Primary Beneficiary**: The instructor ("Guess who will have learned most from the course? You.")
- **Outcome**: The course development process provides "crispness" to your understanding of your own work
- This improved understanding makes the effort "extremely worthwhile" in itself

### Leverage Emotional Rewards
- **Immediate Reward**: A successful training process is "nothing short of exhilarating."
- **Ultimate Reward**: Seeing a subordinate practice the taught material creates a "warm feeling" that "dwarfs" the exhilaration
- **Strategic Advice**: "Relish the exhilaration and warmth" to build resilience for "tackling the second course."

## Key Variables
- **training_list**: List of identified training topics ranging from simple to complex
- **course_length**: Recommended initial duration of 3-4 lectures
- **feedback_form**: Tool for collecting numerical ratings and open-ended comments
- **instructor_experience**: Length of time performing the job being taught

## Constraints
- Manager must accept that the first iteration of training will be unsatisfactory
- Requires availability of knowledgeable subordinates for initial pilot
- Explaining skills is harder than practicing them

## Expected Outcome
A delivered training course that is refined through iterative feedback, potentially scalable via trained instructors, with the instructor gaining deeper self-knowledge and emotional satisfaction.
