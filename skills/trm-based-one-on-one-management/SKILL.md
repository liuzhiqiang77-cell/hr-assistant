# TRM-Based One-on-One Management

## When to Use
- Scheduling recurring one-on-one meetings with subordinates
- Determining how often to meet based on the subordinate's experience with specific tasks
- Preparing for and conducting effective one-on-one sessions
- Adjusting meeting frequency when electronic communication systems are available and span of control has increased

## Define Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

TRM is a combination of:
- The subordinate's achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility
- Their education, training, and experience
- **Specific to the task** - not general maturity

A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another. Even seasoned managers have low TRM in new roles, when environments change, or when job pace accelerates.

## Determine Meeting Frequency

Assess TRM and adjust frequency accordingly:

**High Rate of Change Areas (e.g., Marketing):**
- Increase frequency to stay current on rapid developments
- Schedule more frequently even for experienced subordinates

**Low Rate of Change Areas (e.g., Research):**
- Decrease frequency as life is quieter
- Less frequent meetings may suffice for same TRM level

**Base Frequency by TRM:**
- Inexperienced in specific task: Meet weekly
- Experienced veteran: Meet every few weeks

**Electronic Communication Adaptation:**
When electronic information systems are available and span of control has increased (e.g., 10+ reports):
- Reduce meeting frequency compared to traditional standards
- Shorten meeting duration
- Focus on mutual education and specific problem exchange rather than general status updates
- Employees are already informed via networks; don't replicate what they already know

## Prepare for the Meeting

**Duration:** Minimum 1 hour. Less time limits discussion to simple issues; big problems need time to explore.

**Location:** Prefer the subordinate's work area to:
- Observe organization and document retrieval
- Monitor interruption patterns
- Understand their work approach

**Ownership:** The meeting belongs to the subordinate:
- Agenda and tone are set by them
- They must prepare an outline in advance
- This forces them to think through issues beforehand

**Scheduling:** Use a rolling basis:
- Set up the next meeting as the current one ends
- Avoids cancellations from fixed schedules (e.g., "every second Wednesday")

**Remote Meetings:**
- Supervisor must receive the outline before the meeting starts
- Exchange notes after the meeting to document commitments (visual cues are missing)

## Conduct the Meeting

**Content to Cover:**
- Performance figures and indicators (especially those signaling trouble)
- Events since last meeting: hiring problems, people issues, organizational issues, future plans
- Potential problems: even intangible intuitions that "something is wrong"
- Issues that preoccupy and nag the subordinate (often obscure and time-consuming)

**Supervisor Role - Facilitate and Coach:**
- Learn from the subordinate
- Coach them through problems
- **Grove's Principle of Didactic Management:** When you think the subordinate is finished, ask one more question to keep thoughts flowing until the root is reached

**Mechanical Techniques:**
- **Note-taking:** Both parties take notes on the outline
  - Keeps minds from drifting
  - Aids digestion
  - Forces logical categorization
  - Writing implies a commitment to act (like a handshake)
- **Hold File:** Accumulate important but non-urgent issues
  - Applies batching principle to minimize ad hoc interruptions
  - Discuss accumulated issues at scheduled times

**Handle Heart-to-Heart Issues:**
- Encourage discussion of deep work-related problems (satisfaction, frustration, doubts)
- **Beware of the "Zinger":** A critical issue raised at the end when there's no time to address it (e.g., announcing resignation)

## Validate the Approach

One-on-one meetings remain absolutely necessary even with electronic communication. Their scope has narrowed from general updates to:
- Mutual education
- Specific problems
- Skills and know-how transfer
- Coaching and mentorship
