# TRM Assessment Examples

## Low TRM Scenarios
- A seasoned manager starting in a new department
- An experienced employee facing accelerated job pace
- Anyone dealing with abrupt job changes
- New environment or content unfamiliar to the person

## High TRM Scenarios
- Veteran employee performing routine tasks
- Someone with extensive specific task experience
- Stable environment with familiar work patterns

## TRM vs General Maturity

A highly mature, experienced manager may have LOW TRM if:
- The technology is new to them
- The organizational culture is different
- The specific processes are unfamiliar

Conversely, a junior employee may have HIGH TRM for:
- Tasks they've performed repeatedly
- Technologies they've mastered
- Processes they know intimately

## Monitoring Timing Examples

### Lowest-Added-Value Stage Monitoring
- **Report Writing**: Review outline and rough draft, not just final polished version
- **Software Development**: Review design documents and early code, not just completed feature
- **Project Planning**: Review initial timeline and resource estimates, not just final plan

### Sampling Approach
- Review 3-5 random data points rather than entire dataset
- Spot-check 2-3 sections of a document rather than reading every word
- Attend 1-2 team meetings rather than all weekly standups
