# TRM-Based Delegation and Monitoring

## When to Use This Skill
- Delegating tasks to subordinates
- Assessing a subordinate's readiness for specific work
- Determining appropriate supervision levels
- Establishing shared operational values to enable delegation
- Monitoring delegated work without micromanaging

## Core Concepts

### Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)
TRM is specific to the task at hand, not general competence. It combines:
- Achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience relevant to the specific task

A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another. TRM can change day by day or hour by hour based on environment, pace, or job changes.

### Operational Values
Before effective delegation can occur, you must establish a common information base with your subordinate:
- Shared understanding of how the organization works together
- Common priorities and preferences
- The supervisor is accountable for teaching these values
- Never let subordinates "pay tuition" through customer-impacting mistakes

## Delegation Workflow

### Step 1: Establish Common Information Base
Ensure you and your subordinate share operational values, priorities, and preferences. Without this, delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage.

### Step 2: Assess TRM
Evaluate the subordinate's maturity for the specific task:
- **Low TRM**: New to task, environment, or pace has accelerated
- **Medium/Growing TRM**: Gaining experience and responsibility
- **High TRM**: Experienced veteran with this specific task

### Step 3: Select Tasks to Delegate
- Delegate activities familiar to you rather than unfamiliar ones
- Easier to monitor tasks you know best
- Avoid insincere delegation (emotionally holding onto tasks while pretending to delegate)

### Step 4: Delegate with Clear Responsibility
Remember: "Delegation without follow-through is abdication." You never wash your hands of the task.

## Monitoring Workflow

### Step 1: Apply Quality Assurance Principles

**Principle 1: Monitor at the Lowest-Added-Value Stage**
- Review rough drafts rather than final polished versions
- Catch basic content problems early before expensive polishing

**Principle 2: Use Sampling, Not 100% Inspection**
- Check details randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress
- Avoid checking every detail (like 100% QA testing)

### Step 2: Adjust Monitoring Frequency Based on TRM
- **Low TRM**: Monitor frequently and closely
- **Medium TRM**: Moderate monitoring
- **High TRM**: Decrease intensity as work improves over time

### Step 3: Avoid Meddling
- Focus on outcomes and progress, not prescribing specific activities
- Monitor to ensure activity proceeds in line with expectations

## Key Principles
- The supervisor is accountable for subordinate output
- Operational values must be shared before effective delegation
- TRM is task-specific, not a general trait
- Monitor early drafts, not just final products
- Adjust supervision based on task-relevant maturity, not general experience
