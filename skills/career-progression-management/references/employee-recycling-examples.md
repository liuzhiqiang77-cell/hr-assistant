# Employee Recycling Procedure

## When to Use Recycling

Trigger condition:
```
IF (promoted employee performs below-average for extended time) THEN
    Execute recycling procedure
```

**Recognition**: A person has been promoted into a position "so much over his head" that they perform below-average for an extended time.

## Recycling Process

### Step 1: Solution Selection

Choose to **recycle** the employee rather than terminate them.

### Step 2: Definition of Recycling

Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion.

### Step 3: Management Accountability

Management must admit it was **"at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness"** for more responsibility.

### Step 4: Implementation

- Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do
- Support the employee in the face of likely "embarrassment"
- Execute the recycling "openly" to reduce stigma

### Step 5: Expected Outcome

- The embarrassment will be "short-lived"
- The employee will regain confidence
- Once confidence is regained, the employee becomes an "excellent candidate for another promotion" at a later time and is likely to succeed

## Prohibited Action

**DO NOT force the employee to leave the company.**

Reject the rationalization that: "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake."

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Engineer Promoted to Engineering Manager

**Background**:
- Individual contributor engineer, excellent technical performer
- Consistently "exceeds requirements" in coding and design
- Promoted to manage team of 8 engineers

**Outcome**:
- Struggles with people management
- Misses deadlines due to poor delegation
- Team morale declines
- Performance at new role: "below requirements" for 6 months

**Recycling Decision**:
- Management admits: "We misjudged his readiness for management"
- Action: Return to individual contributor role, perhaps as "Principal Engineer"
- Conversation: "We recognize this promotion didn't work out. We value your technical contributions and want you back in the role where you excel. We made a mistake, not you."

**Long-term Result**:
- Employee regains confidence as top technical contributor
- 18 months later, promoted to "Engineering Architect" (different management track with different responsibilities)
- Succeeds in new role

### Scenario 2: Sales Rep Promoted to Sales Manager

**Background**:
- Top-performing sales representative
- Consistently #1 in territory performance
- Promoted to manage regional team of 5 reps

**Outcome**:
- Cannot coach or develop other reps
- Team performance declines under his leadership
- He tries to do all the selling himself (won't delegate)
- Performance: "below requirements" for 4 months

**Recycling Decision**:
- Action: Return to "Senior Sales Representative" role
- Create "Mentor" designation where he can share best practices without formal management
- Conversation: "Your strength is in selling, not managing. We want you back doing what you do best, with recognition as a senior contributor."

**Long-term Result**:
- Employee becomes top salesperson again
- Becomes informal mentor to new reps
- Never seeks management promotion again (self-awareness)

### Scenario 3: Financial Analyst Promoted to Finance Manager

**Background**:
- Strong financial analyst, great at spreadsheets and modeling
- Promoted to manage finance department of 4 people

**Outcome**:
- Good at technical oversight but poor at leadership
- Team members quit due to micromanagement
- Misses strategic priorities while focused on details
- Performance: "below requirements" for 8 months

**Recycling Decision**:
- Action: Return to "Senior Financial Analyst" role
- Create "Finance Systems Lead" role where he owns all models without managing people
- Conversation: "We recognize your analytical skills are exceptional. Let's put you back in a role where those skills drive maximum value, and let someone else handle the people management."

**Long-term Result**:
- Employee thrives in systems role, implements new financial modeling platform
- 2 years later, promoted to "Director of FP&A" after completing leadership development program
- Succeeds because he chose to be promoted and was prepared

## Key Success Factors

1. **Openness about management error**: When management admits fault, it reduces the employee's shame

2. **Fast action**: Don't wait too long; extended poor performance damages confidence irreparably

3. **Public handling**: When done openly, the team sees that the company values talent and provides second chances

4. **Clear communication**: Be explicit about why the recycling is happening and what the future holds

5. **Future hope**: Make it clear that future promotion opportunities exist, just not in this specific role/timing
