name: Career Progression Management
description: Design compensation systems for middle and senior managers (bonus and base pay), follow the promotion performance cycle (promote when 'exceeds requirements'), and execute employee recycling when promotions fail. Use when making decisions about compensation structures, promotions, or demotion for managers and employees.

# Career Progression Management

Manage the full lifecycle of career progression: compensation design, promotion decisions, and recovery from failed promotions.

## When to Use
- Designing or reviewing compensation structures for middle/senior managers
- Deciding whether to promote an employee
- Managing an employee who is struggling after a promotion
- Determining bonus percentages and base pay strategies

## Component 1: Compensation System Design

### Design Performance Bonus (Variable Pay)

#### Step 1: Determine Bonus Percentage

| Role | Bonus as % of Total Compensation |
|------|--------------------------------|
| Middle Manager | 10% - 25% |
| Senior Manager | Up to 50% |

**Rationale**: Higher earners have less material utility for incremental dollars; higher percentage needed for feedback while avoiding hardship from fluctuations.

#### Step 2: Define Bonus Factors

Split bonus among factors based on performance scope:

| Factor | Weight | Example Metric |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Individual Performance | Variable | Supervisor's subjective judgment |
| Immediate Team Objective | Variable | Department KPIs (e.g., revenue, customer satisfaction) |
| Corporate Financial Performance | Variable | Company profit, stock price, revenue |

**Recommended**: 3-factor split balances individual, team, and organizational alignment.

#### Step 3: Establish Timing

- Pay bonus close enough to work time so subordinate remembers why it was awarded
- Account for cause/effect time offsets (some results take time to materialize)

#### Step 4: Select Metrics

Options in order of preference:
1. **Countable items** (financial metrics, units shipped)
2. **Measurable objectives** (goals with specific targets)
3. **Subjective elements** (last resort; may lead to "beauty contest")

### Design Salary Administration (Base Pay)

#### Select Administration Scheme

| Scheme | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| Experience-Only | Pay based strictly on time (X time = Y pay) | Easy, predictable | Ignores merit, demotivates high performers |
| Merit-Only | Pay based on performance only | Fair, motivating | Hard to ignore experience, difficult to implement |
| Compromise (Recommended) | "Family of curves" - starts together, different rates | Balances experience and merit | Requires competitive evaluation |

**Recommended Approach (Family of Curves)**:
- Start everyone at same salary level
- Individuals move up at different speeds based on performance
- Shape approximates experience-only curve but allows variance

#### Implement Competitive Ranking (Required for Merit)

**Principle**: If someone is first, someone else must be last (similar to sports rankings).

Accept that merit-based systems require competitive, comparative evaluation.

## Component 2: Promotion Performance Cycle

### The Promotion Logic

```
1. Initial State: Employee at Job 1, performing at "meets requirements" (average)

2. Improvement Phase: With training and motivation, performance improves to
   "exceeds requirements" (above average)

3. Promotion Trigger: Once "exceeds requirements", employee is "promotable"

4. Promotion: Employee promoted to Job 2

5. Performance Reset: In Job 2, employee initially performs at "meets requirements"
   due to new challenges

6. Cycle Repetition: With experience, improves to "exceeds requirements" → another promotion

7. Cycle Conclusion: Employee settles at "meets requirements" and is no longer promoted
   (reaching their "level of incompetence")
```

### Critical Decision Rule

```
IF Employee Performance Rating = "Exceeds Requirements":
    THEN Evaluate for Promotion
    
IF Employee Performance Rating = "Meets Requirements":
    THEN Maintain Current Level
    
CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:
    IF Employee "Exceeds Requirements" AND is NOT promoted:
        THEN Employee will atrophy and performance permanently returns to "Meets Requirements"
```

### Promotion Decision Framework

| Condition | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Consistently exceeds requirements | Promote | Employee has mastered current role and needs new challenges |
| Meets requirements | Maintain | Employee is appropriately placed |
| Below requirements | Develop or remove | Performance improvement required before promotion consideration |
