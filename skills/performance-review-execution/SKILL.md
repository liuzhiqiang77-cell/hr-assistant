# Performance Review Execution

## The Fundamental Purpose

While reviews serve multiple functions, the **primary goal is to improve the subordinate's performance**.

### Core Focus Areas

1. **Skill Level**: Identify missing skills and find ways to remedy them
2. **Motivation**: Intensify motivation to move the subordinate to a higher performance curve

### Secondary Purposes (Recognize but Prioritize)

- Assessing work, motivating, providing feedback
- Justifying raises, rewarding, discipline, direction
- Reinforcing culture

## Time Offset and Long-Term Assessment

When reviewing performance where results lag behind activities:

### Analyze Time Offset

- Determine if output in the review period is linked to activities in the same period
- Recognize that current output may be the "light from distant stars" (reflecting work done years ago)

### Judge Performance Based on Activities

- If tangible output is absent but activities were strong, give credit for performance
- Do not penalize for lack of immediate output if building future capacity

### Apply Present Value Concept

- Estimate how much future-oriented activity will pay back over time
- Determine what that future value is worth today to decide current significance

## The Potential Trap Rule

### Rule Statement

**The performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the rating accorded to his organization.**

### Application

1. **Assess Substance over Form**: Evaluate actual performance and real output; ignore "potential" defined as form (knowledge, handling oneself well, looking like a manager)

2. **Apply the Organization Cap**: Compare manager's rating to organization's rating

3. **Enforce Consequences**: If the business unit lost money, missed forecasts, slipped schedules, or showed poor internal measures, the manager cannot receive a high rating

4. **Prevent Negative Signaling**: Avoid signaling that "acting" like a manager is sufficient; reinforce that "performing" like a manager is required

## Review Integrity and Delivery Protocols

### Handling Self-Reviews

- **Do NOT** ask for a self-review if you intend to simply change the format and hand it back
- If you rely on the subordinate to tell you their accomplishments, you appear unaware and they feel cheated
- Preserve the integrity of your judgment by making an upfront assessment without being prompted

### Handling Upward Feedback

- You may ask the subordinate to evaluate your performance as a supervisor
- **Constraint**: Clearly state their assessment has only "advisory status"
- **Constraint**: Never pretend you and subordinates are equals; you are the leader

### Timing of Written Review Delivery

| Approach | Recommendation | Risks |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| During Discussion | Not Recommended | Subordinate reads ahead; no time to think; "should have said" something |
| After Discussion | Not Recommended | Subordinate finds phrase they didn't "hear" and reacts negatively |
| **Before Discussion** | **Recommended** | Ensures proper processing time for "good meeting of minds" |

### Enforcing Quality

- If a review is superficial, lacks analysis, or lacks depth, **insist on a rewrite**
- The integrity of the performance review system is more important than the subordinate's preference to avoid spending time

## When to Use This Skill

- Conducting formal performance reviews
- Evaluating manager or employee performance
- Designing or improving review processes
- Reviewing performance where results lag activities (R&D, long-term projects)
- Assessing managers for promotion or compensation decisions

## Constraints

- Do not apply if the goal is purely administrative without developmental intent
- Requires judgment beyond simple metrics for time offset analysis
- Supervisors must not abdicate judgment to subordinates
