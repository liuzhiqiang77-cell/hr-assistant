# Potential Trap Rule Examples

## Scenario 1: Financially Underperforming Manager

**Manager**: VP of Sales
**Organization Performance**:
- Revenue target: $100M
- Actual: $75M (missed by 25%)
- Internal measures: Pipeline strength poor, forecast accuracy low
- **Organization Rating**: "Below Requirements"

**Manager's Performance Assessment**:
- Great communicator, presents well to board
- Looks like a leader, has executive presence
- Knowledgeable about industry trends
- Proposed Rating: "Exceeds Requirements"

**Potential Trap Violation**: The manager exhibits "form" (looking like a manager) but the organization failed.

**Correct Action**: Cap manager rating at "Below Requirements" to match organization. Send signal that "acting" like a manager is not sufficient - "performing" like a manager is required.

**Manager**: Director of Engineering
**Organization Performance**:
- Major product launch slipped 3 months
- Critical features missing at launch
- Internal quality metrics below threshold
- **Organization Rating**: "Meets Requirements" (barely)

**Manager's Performance Assessment**:

- Provides thoughtful updates and analysis
- Proposed Rating: "Exceeds Requirements"

**Potential Trap Violation**: Excellent people management doesn't compensate for organizational failure.

**Correct Action**: Manager rating cannot exceed "Meets Requirements."

## Scenario 3: Exceptional Performer in Struggling Unit

**Manager**: Marketing Manager for a failing product line
**Organization Performance**:
- Product line revenue declining 40% YoY
- Customer churn at industry highs
- Market share loss to competitors
- **Organization Rating**: "Does Not Meet Requirements"

**Manager's Performance Assessment**:
- Introduced innovative campaigns
- Built strong team foundation
- Created new positioning that may pay off long-term
- Proposed Rating: "Exceeds Requirements"

**Potential Trap Application**: Even if the manager did excellent work, the organization failed. 

**Correct Action**: Manager rating capped at "Does Not Meet Requirements."

**Nuance**: Document specific achievements for future reference, but organizational results dictate the rating cap. This is why the rule is named "The Potential Trap" - it prevents rewarding potential over actual performance.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. The "It's Not His Fault" Exception
**Incorrect**: "The market turned against us, but the manager did everything right."
**Correct**: Managers are paid to deal with market conditions. If the organization fails, the manager rating is capped.

### 2. The "Form Over Substance" Rating
**Incorrect**: "She acts like a senior executive, attends all the right meetings, networks well - outstanding performance."
**Correct**: These are "form" attributes. What did the organization actually deliver? That determines the rating ceiling.

### 3. The "Future Value" Override
**Incorrect**: "The organization failed this year, but his foundation building will pay off next year. Rate him exceeds."
**Correct**: Future value matters for development discussions but does not override the current organization rating cap.
