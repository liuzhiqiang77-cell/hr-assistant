# Materials Support Supervisor Performance Evaluation Example

## Context
- Review Period: 2/82 - 8/82
- Role Transition: Finance to Manufacturing
- Responsibilities: Production planning process and manufacturing specifications process

## Evaluation Framework

### Production Planning Assessment
**Criteria:**
- Significant process changes during review period
- Site coordination and administrative activity efficiency

**Rating:** "good" if sites are well coordinated and activities are efficiently done

### Manufacturing Specifications Assessment

**Goal Setting Assessment:**
- Positive: Defines "clear, concise, and specific goals"
- Negative Indicators:
  * Difficulty setting objectives and key results
  * "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews (e.g., March review)
  * Lack of definitive statement on system direction
- Consequence: Falling into trap of "working on" things without reaching objectives

**Meeting Effectiveness Assessment:**
- Negative Indicator: Satisfaction that having a meeting constitutes progress
- Corrective Action: Must define specific results to accomplish prior to each meeting

### Strengths & Background Utilization
- Speed of learning (getting up to speed quickly to take over from predecessor)

**Required Capabilities:**
- Must be able to take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system) and show results
- Required Actions:
  * Clear and concise breakdown of problems
  * Identification of goals
  * Establishment of the way to achieve those goals

**Independence Requirement:**

### Final Rating Determination

**Meets Requirements:**
- Assigned if capable of doing current job
- Acknowledging specific areas (goal setting, defining ways of accomplishing tasks) need improvement

**Context Adjustment:**
- Consider environmental transition difficulties (finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance
