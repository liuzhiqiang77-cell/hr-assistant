# Performance Evaluation Framework

## Core Evaluation Principles

### Goal Clarity Assessment

Determine if the employee defines "clear, concise, and specific goals":

- **Negative Indicators**:
  - Difficulty setting objectives and key results
  - "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews
  - Lack of definitive statement on system direction
  - "Working on" things without reaching objectives

### Meeting Effectiveness Assessment

Determine if the employee confuses holding meetings with actual progress:

- **Negative Indicator**: Satisfaction that having a meeting on a subject constitutes progress
- **Corrective Action**: Employee must define specific results to accomplish PRIOR to each meeting

### Project Independence

Evaluate ability to be the primary driver on complex projects:

- **Requirement**: Must be able to take complex projects and show results
- **Independence Standard**: Employee must be the primary driver; supervisor helps only when needed
- **Promotion Contingency**: Demonstration of independent work capability

### Promotion Eligibility Criteria

**Required Capabilities**:
1. Clear and concise breakdown of problems
2. Identification of goals
3. Establishment of the way to achieve those goals
4. Ability to be the primary driver on complex projects

**Current Status**: Promotion denied if specific criteria are not met, regardless of desire.
