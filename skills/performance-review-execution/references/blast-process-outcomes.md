## High Achiever Review Examples

### Before (Common Pitfall)
"John exceeded all targets this year. His sales numbers were 20% above quota. He mentored two new team members. His customer satisfaction scores were excellent. He deserves an Exceeds Expectations rating and is eligible for the maximum bonus."

**Problem**: Purely retrospective, justifies rating, no forward guidance.

### After (Correct Approach)
"John exceeded all targets this year—sales 20% above quota, excellent customer satisfaction, and successful mentoring of two new team members. For next year, John should focus on: 1) Expanding into the enterprise market segment, 2) Developing a systematic coaching approach for new hires, and 3) Cross-training on the technical solution architecture to support complex deals. This will position John for potential leadership roles in 18-24 months."

**Correct**: Acknowledges past performance and provides specific development path.
