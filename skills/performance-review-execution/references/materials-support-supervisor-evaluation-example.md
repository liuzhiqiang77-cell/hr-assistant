# Materials Support Supervisor Performance Evaluation Example

This example illustrates the application of performance review principles to a specific role transition (Finance to Manufacturing).

## Core Responsibilities
- Managing production planning process
- Managing manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

## Evaluation Criteria

### Production Planning Performance
- Significant process changes during review period
- Site coordination and administrative activity efficiency
- Rating: "good" if sites are well coordinated and activities are efficiently done

### Manufacturing Specifications Performance

**Goal Setting Assessment**
- **Positive**: Defines "clear, concise, and specific goals"
- **Negative Indicators**:
  - Difficulty setting objectives and key results
  - "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews
  - Lack of definitive statement on system direction
- **Consequence**: Falling into trap of "working on" things without reaching objectives

**Meeting Effectiveness Assessment**
- **Negative Indicator**: Satisfaction that having a meeting constitutes progress
- **Corrective Action**: Define specific results to accomplish PRIOR to each meeting

### Strengths & Background Utilization
- Speed of learning (getting up to speed quickly)
- Utilization of prior background (e.g., finance) to assist other areas voluntarily

## Promotion Eligibility

**Current Status**: Promotion denied if specific criteria not met

**Required Capabilities**
- Must take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system) and show results
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of the way to achieve goals

**Independence Requirement**
- Employee must be "primary driver"
- Supervisor helps only when needed
- Promotion contingent on demonstrating capability for independent work

## Final Rating Determination

**Meets Requirements**: Assigned if capable of doing current job, but acknowledging specific areas (goal setting, defining ways of accomplishing tasks) need improvement

**Context Adjustment**: Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance
