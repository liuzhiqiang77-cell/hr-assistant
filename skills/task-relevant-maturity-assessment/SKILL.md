# Task-Relevant Maturity Assessment

## When to Use

- Assessing a subordinate's capability to perform a specific task
- Determining appropriate management style (close vs. loose supervision)
- Setting one-on-one meeting frequency
- Deciding delegation and monitoring intensity
- A subordinate is taking on new responsibilities or a role has changed

## Define Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

**Core Definition**
- TRM is a combination of:
  - Achievement orientation (drive to achieve)
  - Readiness to take responsibility
  - Education specific to the task
  - Training specific to the task
  - Experience with the specific task

**Critical Distinction**
- TRM is NOT general maturity
- TRM is specific to the task at hand
- High general maturity does NOT guarantee high TRM in a new role

## Assess TRM Factors

**Achievement Orientation**
- Degree to which the subordinate is driven to achieve
- Motivation to excel in the specific task

**Readiness for Responsibility**
- Willingness to be accountable for outcomes
- Comfort with ownership of results

**Experience and Education**
- Training directly relevant to the task
- Background specific to the current work
- Performance history with similar tasks

## Recognize Context-Specific TRM

**High in One Area, Low in Another**
- Person can have high TRM in one job and low TRM in another
- Always assess TRM relative to the specific task, not the person overall

**Factors Causing Low TRM**
- New environment, content, or tasks
- Sudden acceleration of job pace
- Abrupt changes to the job itself
- Even seasoned managers can have low TRM in unfamiliar territory

**Dynamic Nature**
- TRM can change day by day or hour by hour
- Reassess when circumstances change
- Monitor for shifts in capability as subordinate gains experience

## Apply TRM to Management Decisions

**Management Style Adjustment**
- **Low TRM**: Close supervision, detailed instructions
- **Growing TRM**: Gradually loosen supervision, increase delegation
- **High TRM**: Loose supervision, minimal intervention

**Monitoring Frequency**
- **Low TRM**: Frequent monitoring, early-stage reviews
- **Growing TRM**: Decrease monitoring intensity, trust increases
- **High TRM**: Minimal monitoring, focus on outcomes

**Meeting Frequency**
- **Low TRM**: Weekly or more frequent one-on-ones
- **High TRM**: Less frequent meetings (every few weeks)

**Delegation Appropriateness**
- Low TRM: Delegate only with clear instructions and close monitoring
- High TRM: Can delegate with common information base and minimal oversight
