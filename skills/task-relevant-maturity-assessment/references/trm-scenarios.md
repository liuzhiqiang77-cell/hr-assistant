# TRM Scenario Examples

## Scenario 1: The Experienced Manager, New Role

**Situation**: Maria has been a manager for 15 years and is highly respected. She's just been promoted to lead a new division in a completely different industry.

**General Maturity**: High
**TRM for New Role**: Low

**Why**: Despite her general management experience, she lacks:
- Industry knowledge
- Understanding of the specific products
- Relationships with key stakeholders
- Familiarity with the regulatory environment

**Management Approach**: Close supervision initially, even though she's an experienced manager. Provide industry-specific training and introductions.

## Scenario 2: The Junior Employee, Familiar Task

**Situation**: Alex is a 22-year-old new hire who just graduated. However, the task is setting up social media accounts—a process he's done extensively for personal projects and volunteer work.

**General Maturity**: Low
**TRM for This Task**: High

**Why**: While new to the corporate world, Alex has:
- Deep experience with social media platforms
- Understanding of best practices
- Familiarity with the tools and processes
- Proven ability to execute this specific work

**Management Approach**: Delegate with outcome focus. Monitor results, not process. Don't micromanage just because he's junior.

## Scenario 3: The High Performer, Accelerated Pace

**Situation**: Jordan consistently exceeds expectations in data analysis. Suddenly, the company needs daily reports instead of weekly, cutting analysis time by 80%.

**General Maturity**: High
**TRM for Accelerated Task**: Medium (dropped from High)

**Why**: The pace change creates:
- Time pressure that may lead to errors
- Need for process optimization
- Stress that affects decision-making
- Risk of cutting corners

**Management Approach**: Increase monitoring temporarily. Help optimize processes. Support through the transition period.

## Scenario 4: The Veteran, Technology Change

**Situation**: Sam has been a successful salesperson for 20 years. The company is implementing a new CRM system that completely changes the sales workflow.

**General Maturity**: High
**TRM for New Workflow**: Low

**Why**: Despite sales expertise, Sam lacks:
- Familiarity with the new system
- Understanding of the new process
- Confidence with the technology
- Experience with the new workflow

**Management Approach**: Treat as if learning a new job. Provide hands-on training. Monitor closely until proficiency is achieved.

## Scenario 5: The Low Performer, Simple Task

**Situation**: Taylor consistently underperforms and shows low initiative. The task is basic data entry—simple, repetitive work.

**General Maturity**: Low
**TRM for Simple Task**: Medium

**Why**: While Taylor has general maturity issues:
- The task is straightforward and well-defined
- Previous experience with similar data entry
- Clear expectations and processes
- Low complexity reduces risk

**Management Approach**: Provide clear instructions and monitor quality. Use this as an opportunity to build confidence and achievement orientation.

## Scenario 6: The High Achiever, Expanded Scope

**Situation**: Riley is a star performer who excels at managing small projects. Suddenly assigned to lead a company-wide initiative involving 50 people across 5 departments.

**General Maturity**: High
**TRM for Expanded Scope**: Medium

**Why**: Despite strong performance:
- Scale is significantly larger
- More stakeholders to manage
- Higher complexity and interdependencies
- Greater visibility and consequences

**Management Approach**: Provide coaching on large-scale management. Check in frequently initially. Gradually reduce oversight as Riley demonstrates capability.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Never assume**: General maturity does not guarantee high TRM for any specific task

2. **Context matters**: Environment, pace, scope, and technology all affect TRM

3. **TRM is dynamic**: It can change rapidly as conditions change

4. **Assess specifically**: Evaluate TRM for each task, not for the person overall

5. **Adjust accordingly**: Management style must match current TRM, not past performance or general reputation
