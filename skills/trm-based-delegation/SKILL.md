# TRM-Based Delegation Management

This skill provides a systematic approach to delegation based on Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM), enabling effective task assignment, appropriate supervision, and quality monitoring.

## When to Use
- Delegating new tasks to subordinates
- Determining how closely to supervise a subordinate's work
- Monitoring progress on delegated tasks without micromanaging
- Adjusting management style as subordinates gain experience

## Step 1: Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

TRM is specific to the task at hand, not general competence or experience.

### Evaluate TRM Factors
1. **Achievement Orientation**: Degree to which the subordinate is driven to achieve
2. **Readiness for Responsibility**: Willingness to be accountable for outcomes
3. **Education and Training**: Relevant background specific to the task
4. **Experience**: Prior performance with similar tasks

### Determine TRM Level
- **Low TRM**: New to task, environment, or pace has accelerated
- **Medium/Growing TRM**: Gaining experience and confidence
- **High TRM**: Experienced veteran with proven track record

**Critical Note**: A person can have high TRM in one job but low TRM in another. TRM can change day by day or hour by hour.

## Step 2: Select and Delegate Tasks

### Prerequisite Check
Ensure you and the subordinate share a **common information base** and operational ideas. Without this, delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage.

### Task Selection Rule
When given a choice, **delegate activities that are familiar to you** rather than unfamiliar ones.

**Reasoning**: It is easier to monitor tasks you know best.

### Avoid Insincere Delegation
Do not emotionally hold onto tasks while pretending to delegate. If you keep a task because you enjoy it, make it a conscious decision rather than a charade.

### Delegate with Clear Expectations
- Define desired outcomes clearly
- Establish deadlines and quality standards
- Confirm understanding of the task

## Step 3: Monitor Based on TRM

**Core Principle**: "Delegation without follow-through is abdication." You never wash your hands of the task; you remain responsible for its accomplishment.

### Quality Assurance Principle 1: Timing
Monitor at the **lowest-added-value stage** of the process.

**Example**: Review rough drafts of reports rather than waiting for final polished versions to catch basic content problems early.

### Quality Assurance Principle 2: Sampling
Do not check 100% of details. Go into details randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress.

### Adjust Frequency Based on TRM
| TRM Level | Monitoring Frequency | Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| Low | High (daily or frequent check-ins) | Close supervision, detailed review |
| Medium/Growing | Moderate (weekly or bi-weekly) | Periodic review, spot checks |
| High | Low (monthly or as needed) | Minimal supervision, results-focused |

**Adjustment**: Increase monitoring frequency for newly delegated tasks; decrease intensity as the subordinate's work improves over time.

## Key Anti-Patterns
- **Meddling**: Prescribing specific activities rather than monitoring outcomes
- **Abdication**: Delegating without any follow-up or accountability
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Using the same supervision approach regardless of TRM
- **Generalizing**: Assuming high general competence equals high TRM for new tasks

## Expected Outcome
Effective delegation where subordinates take appropriate responsibility, work proceeds according to expectations, and managerial leverage increases over time.
