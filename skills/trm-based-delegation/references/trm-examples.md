# TRM Assessment Examples

## Low TRM Scenarios
- A seasoned manager starting in a new industry
- An engineer assigned to manage a project for the first time
- A sales rep moved from enterprise sales to retail
- Any employee when job pace abruptly accelerates

## High TRM Scenarios
- A veteran employee performing their core responsibilities
- Someone who has successfully completed similar tasks repeatedly
- An employee with proven track record in specific domain

## TRM Changes
TRM is dynamic and can shift based on:
- New technology or tools
- Organizational changes
- Accelerated work pace
- Task complexity changes
- Team composition changes

Remember: Always assess TRM for the specific task, not the person generally.
