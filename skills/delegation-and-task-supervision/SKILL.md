# Delegation and Task Supervision

Effective delegation requires shared values, accurate assessment of capability, and appropriate monitoring. This skill provides a complete workflow for delegating work and ensuring successful outcomes.

## When to Use

- Delegating tasks to free up managerial time
- Assessing a subordinate's readiness for specific responsibilities
- Monitoring work that has been delegated
- Establishing new reporting relationships
- Onboarding new subordinates

## Core Workflow

### 1. Establish Shared Operational Values

Before delegating, ensure you and your subordinate share a common understanding of:

- **Operational values**: The correct way to do things
- **Priorities**: What matters most in the organization
- **Preferences**: How work gets done together

**Critical Principle**: The supervisor is accountable for subordinate output. You cannot effectively delegate without shared values.

**Anti-Pattern**: Do not allow subordinates to "pay tuition" by making mistakes that impact customers. Teach correct operational values early.

### 2. Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

TRM is specific to the task, not general competence. Evaluate:

- Achievement orientation (drive to succeed)
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Relevant education, training, and experience

**Key Insight**: A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another. TRM can change day-to-day or hour-to-hour based on pace, environment, or task changes.

### 3. Select and Delegate Tasks

**Prerequisites for Delegation**:
- Common information base exists between you and the subordinate
- Shared operational ideas and values

**Task Selection Rules**:
- Delegate activities familiar to you (easier to monitor)
- Avoid insincere delegation (emotionally holding on while pretending to delegate)
- Never wash your hands of the task—you remain responsible

**Core Principle**: "Delegation without follow-through is abdication."

### 4. Monitor Delegated Tasks

Apply quality assurance principles without meddling:

**Timing Principle**: Monitor at the lowest-added-value stage
- Example: Review rough drafts before final polished versions
- Catch basic problems early before expensive rework

**Sampling Principle**: Do not check 100% of details
- Review randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress
- Avoid micromanagement

**Frequency Adjustment**: Base monitoring intensity on TRM
- High monitoring for newly delegated tasks
- Decrease intensity as subordinate's work improves

## Decision Points

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No common information base | Provide specific instructions; delegation yields low leverage |
| Subordinate new to task | Increase monitoring frequency |
| Subordinate experienced with task | Decrease monitoring intensity |
| Task familiar to manager | Good candidate for delegation |
| Task unfamiliar to manager | Poor candidate for delegation |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Meddling**: Prescribing specific activities instead of monitoring outcomes
- **Customer Tuition**: Letting subordinates learn through customer-impacting mistakes
- **Insincere Delegation**: Holding onto tasks emotionally while pretending to delegate
- **Generalizing TRM**: Assuming high general competence equals high task-specific maturity
- **Abdication**: Delegating without follow-through or monitoring
