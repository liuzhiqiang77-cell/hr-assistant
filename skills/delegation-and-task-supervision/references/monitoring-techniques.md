# Monitoring Delegated Tasks - Detailed Techniques

## Quality Assurance Principle 1: Timing

### Monitor at Lowest-Added-Value Stage

**Definition**: The earliest point in a process where basic problems can be identified before expensive polishing occurs.

**Examples**:
- **Reports**: Review rough drafts, not final polished versions
- **Code**: Review design documents before implementation
- **Presentations**: Review outline before slide creation
- **Projects**: Review plans before execution begins

**Benefits**:
- Catch fundamental issues early
- Avoid wasted effort on wrong direction
- Enable course correction with minimal cost

## Quality Assurance Principle 2: Sampling

### Random Spot-Checking

**Approach**:
- Do not check 100% of details
- Go into details randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress
- Focus on representative samples

**Contrast with Meddling**:
- **Monitoring**: Checking outcomes and progress at key points
- **Meddling**: Prescribing specific activities and methods

## Frequency Determination Matrix

| TRM Level | Monitoring Frequency | Example |
|------------|---------------------|---------|
| Low (new to task) | Daily or multiple times per week | First-time project lead |
| Medium (growing) | Weekly | Expanding responsibilities |
| High (experienced) | Bi-weekly or monthly | Routine tasks |

## Adjusting Frequency Over Time

**Start High**: When task is first delegated, monitor frequently

**Decrease Gradually**: As subordinate demonstrates competence:
1. Reduce frequency of check-ins
2. Increase scope of delegated work
3. Shift from detailed review to outcome review

**Increase When Needed**: If problems arise or task changes:
1. Return to higher frequency
2. Provide additional guidance
2. Reassess TRM

## Monitoring vs Meddling

| Monitoring | Meddling |
|------------|----------|
| Focus on outcomes | Focus on methods |
| Checks at key milestones | Checks continuously |
| Asks about progress | Tells how to do it |
| Reviews results | Prescribes activities |
| Enables autonomy | Creates dependency |
