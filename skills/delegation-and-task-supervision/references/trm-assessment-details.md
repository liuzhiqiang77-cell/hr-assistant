# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) Assessment Details

## Definition

TRM is a combination of:
- Achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience

## Key Characteristics

- **Task-Specific**: TRM is specific to the task at hand, not general maturity
- **Dynamic**: Can change day by day or hour by hour
- **Context-Dependent**: Environment, content, and task changes affect TRM

## Factors Causing Low TRM

Even seasoned managers may have low TRM if:
- The environment is new
- The content is unfamiliar
- Tasks are different from previous experience
- The pace of the job accelerates
- The job itself abruptly changes

## TRM vs General Competence

Do not confuse:
- **General competence/maturity**: Overall professional capability
- **Task-Relevant Maturity**: Capability for a specific task

High general maturity does NOT guarantee high TRM in a new role.

## Examples

| Person | General Maturity | Task | TRM |
|--------|------------------|------|-----|
| Senior Engineer | High | First management role | Low |
| Marketing Manager | High | New product launch in unfamiliar market | Low |
| Junior Developer | Low | Bug fixing in familiar codebase | High |
