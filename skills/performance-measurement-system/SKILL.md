# Performance Measurement System

Design balanced indicators, monitor daily operations, and forecast trends effectively.

## When to Use
- Starting daily operations or arriving at office
- Designing or selecting performance metrics
- Monitoring progress toward deadlines or monthly goals
- Forecasting future trends and tracking accuracy
- Evaluating operational performance

## Daily Operational Indicator Set

Review these indicators daily to maintain operational control:

### 1. Sales Forecast
- Determine planned deliveries for today
- Compare with capacity and resources

### 2. Variance Analysis
- Compare yesterday's actual vs. planned deliveries
- Assess confidence in today's forecast

### 3. Raw Material Inventory
- Verify stock levels of essential items
- **Action if too low**: Order more supplies immediately
- **Action if too high**: Cancel scheduled deliveries

### 4. Equipment Condition
- Check for breakdowns from yesterday
- **Action if broken**: Arrange repairs or rearrange production line

### 5. Manpower Assessment
- Check staff availability (sick leave, vacancies)
- **Action if understaffed**: Call temporary help or reallocate staff

### 6. Quality Indicator
- Review customer complaint log
- **Action if high complaints**: Address with specific staff immediately

## Principles of Effective Indicator Design

### Core Principles

1. **Attention Principle**: Indicators direct attention like steering a bicycle
2. **Guard Against Overreaction**: Single metrics can lead to extreme behaviors
3. **Implement Paired Indicators**: Always pair effect with counter-effect

### Administrative Indicator Criteria

| Rule | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Rule 1 | Any measurement is better than none | Start simple, improve over time |
| Rule 2 | Measure Output, not Activity | Orders obtained, not calls made |
| Rule 3 | Measure Physical/Countable things | Vouchers processed, square feet cleaned |

### Paired Indicators Strategy

Always pair metrics to maintain optimum middle ground:

| Primary Metric | Counter Metric | Prevents |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Inventory Levels | Incidence of Shortages | Driving inventory too low |
| Completion Date | Capability | Rushing or perfectionism |
| Vouchers Processed | Errors Found | Speed over quality |
| Square Feet Cleaned | Quality Rating | Quantity over quality |

## Linearity Indicator Analysis

Monitor progress toward deadlines with linear trajectory analysis.

### Method

1. **Plot Actual Output**: Graph actual results against time elapsed
2. **Define Ideal Line**: Linear path from start to target
3. **Compare Progress**: Identify deviation from ideal line

### Interpretation

| Scenario | Pattern | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Below line | Progress slower than needed | Accelerate performance |
| Above line | Progress ahead of schedule | Maintain or reallocate resources |
| Back-loaded | Output concentrated at end | Address resource allocation |

### Purpose
Provides "early warning" to allow corrective action before deadline.

## Stagger Chart Forecasting

Track forecast evolution and business trends over time.

### Structure

- **Rows**: Month the forecast was made
- **Columns**: Future months being forecasted
- **Cells**: Forecasted values

### Process

1. **Initial Forecast**: Fill in forecasts for future months
2. **Update Monthly**: Create new row each month with updated forecasts
3. **Analyze Variations**: Compare forecasts for same target month across different forecast months
4. **Interpret Trends**: Identify improving or deteriorating outlook

### Benefits
- More valuable than simple trend charts
- Shows evolution of expectations
- Forces accountability (forecasts compared to actuals)

## Execution Steps

### For Daily Operations

1. Review sales forecast for today
2. Analyze yesterday's variance
3. Check inventory levels and adjust orders
4. Verify equipment status
5. Assess manpower availability
6. Monitor quality complaints

### For Indicator Design

1. Identify measurable outputs
2. Select primary metrics
3. Design counter-metrics
4. Ensure physical/countable measurements
5. Establish collection mechanisms

### For Progress Monitoring

1. Set target and deadline
2. Plot ideal linear trajectory
3. Track actual progress
4. Identify deviations early
5. Take corrective action

### For Forecasting

1. Create initial stagger chart
2. Update forecasts monthly
3. Compare forecast variations
4. Analyze trend evolution
5. Adjust based on accuracy
