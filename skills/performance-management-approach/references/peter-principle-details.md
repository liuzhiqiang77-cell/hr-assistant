# The Peter Principle: Detailed Analysis

## Selection Criteria Problem

The selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities related to the intended role.

## Promotion Trajectory

1. Employee performs well in current role
2. Employee is promoted based on current success
3. Employee continues to be promoted until reaching a role they are not skilled for
4. Employee stops being promoted once no longer competent
5. Employee remains in role at level of incompetence

## Constraints

- Does not apply if selection is based on competencies specific to the intended role
- Does not apply if skills required for the new role are identical to the current role
