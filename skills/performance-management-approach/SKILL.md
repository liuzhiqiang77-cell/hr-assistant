# Performance Management Approach

## When to Use
- An employee is not performing their job duties
- Making promotion or hiring decisions
- Applying systematic management to any work type
- Diagnosing root causes of performance problems

## Output-Oriented Management

### Core Principle
All employees in an organization "produce" in some sense—whether making physical products, preparing bills, creating software designs, or writing advertising copy.

### Apply Production Principles
- Apply the principles and discipline of manufacturing to all forms of business enterprise
- Use this production-oriented approach to manage the work of managers themselves
- Treat all activities as forms of production with measurable output

### Example Production Role Distribution
- 25% make the products
- 25% support production (supervise, maintain, engineer)
- 25% work in administration (schedule, bill, pay)
- 25% design, sell, and service products

## Employee Performance Diagnosis

### Identify Underperformance
When an employee is not doing their job, determine the root cause.

### Categorize the Problem

**Can't do it (Capability Issue):**
- Employee lacks the capability or skills
- **Solution**: Train the employee

**Won't do it (Motivation Issue):**
- Employee lacks the motivation or willingness
- **Solution**: Motivate the employee

### Key Constraint
There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train.

## The Peter Principle

### Understand the Risk
When an organization selects a candidate for a position based on performance in their current role (rather than abilities related to the intended role), the employee continues to be promoted until they reach a role they are not skilled for.

### Outcome
Managers rise to the level of their incompetence and remain in that role.

### Mitigation
- Base selection decisions on competencies specific to the intended role
- Evaluate skills required for the new position, not just current performance
