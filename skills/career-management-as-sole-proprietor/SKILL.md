# Career Management as Sole Proprietor

## When to Use This Skill
- Managing your own career trajectory
- Seeking employment or considering job changes
- Advising professionals on career development
- Preparing for organizational changes or restructuring
- Addressing stagnation in slow-growth environments

## Core Mindset: You Are a Sole Proprietor

### Fundamental Shift
- You are not an employee; you are a business with one employee: yourself
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- Fellow workers are not primary rivals; they are outnumbered (ratios of 1000:1 to 1,000,000:1) by people working for competing organizations
- **Nobody owes you a career; you own it as a sole proprietor**

## Daily Career Management Actions

### Continuous Value Addition
1. **Dedicate yourself to retaining competitive advantage**
2. **Enhance your value every day**
3. **Hone your competitive advantage**
4. **Learn and adapt constantly**
5. **Be willing to move**: Job to job, industry to industry if necessary
6. **Retrench if needed**: Start again when required

### Goal
Manage your career to avoid becoming a casualty of globalization and the information revolution.

## The Three Self-Assessment Questions

### Question 1: Value Addition
**Ask**: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"

**Action**: Continually look for ways to make things truly better in your department.

**Principle**: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization."

**Standard**: Every hour of the day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people you are responsible for.

### Question 2: Connectivity
**Ask**: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?" (Inside the company and the industry)

**Check**: Do not wait for a supervisor to interpret events.

**Status**: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people" rather than "floating by yourself."

### Question 3: Innovation
**Ask**: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"

**Action**: Personally try new things; do not just read about them.

**Warning**: Do not wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of that workplace.

## Addressing Internal Threats

### The Threat in Slow/No-Growth Environments
- Ambitious junior employees desire upward movement but are blocked by your position
- Your boss faces a dilemma: retain you (doing good job but blocking others) or promote the junior

### Take Responsibility
- Avoid being "in the way"
- Move up or move on
- Proactively manage your position to create opportunities for others while advancing yourself

## Apply Productivity Principles to Your Career

1. **Apply methods of production**: Treat your work output with manufacturing discipline
2. **Exercise managerial leverage**: Focus on high-impact activities
3. **Elicit an athlete's desire for peak performance**: Strive for continuous improvement
