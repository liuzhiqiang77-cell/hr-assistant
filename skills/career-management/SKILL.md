# Career Management

## When to Use
- You are employed or seeking employment
- Navigating career decisions in a global market
- Assessing your value and competitive position
- Planning career development and growth
- Facing internal competition or blocked advancement

## Core Mindset: Sole Proprietor

**You are not an employee; you are a business with one employee: yourself.**

### Key Realities
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- Fellow workers are not primary rivals
- You are outnumbered (ratios of 1000:1, 100,000:1, or 1,000,000:1) by people working for competing organizations
- **"Nobody owes you a career"**—you own it as a sole proprietor

## Daily Career Management Actions

### Continuous Value Enhancement
- Dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competitive advantage
- Enhance your value every day
- Hone your competitive advantage
- Learn and adapt constantly

### Mobility and Flexibility
- Be willing to move from job to job
- Be willing to move from industry to industry if necessary
- Retrench if necessary to start again

### Goal
Manage your career to avoid becoming a casualty of globalization and the information revolution.

## The Three Self-Assessment Questions

### Question 1: Value Addition
**Ask**: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?**

**Action**: Continually look for ways to make things truly better in your department.

**Principle**: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization."

**Standard**: Every hour of the day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people you are responsible for.

### Question 2: Connectivity
**Ask**: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?**

**Scope**: Inside the company AND the industry.

**Check**: Do not wait for a supervisor to interpret events.

**Status**: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people" rather than "floating by yourself."

### Question 3: Innovation
**Ask**: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?**

**Action**: Personally try new things; do not just read about them.

**Warning**: Do not wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of that workplace.

## Addressing Internal Threats

### The Threat
Ambitious junior employees who desire upward movement but are blocked by your position in slow/no-growth environments.

### The Boss's Dilemma
Choosing between:
- Retaining you (doing a good job but blocking others)
- Promoting the junior (potential for future growth)

### Your Responsibility
Avoid being "in the way":
- Move up (seek promotion)
- Move on (find new opportunities)

## Productivity Principles

Apply these to enhance your career value:
- Apply methods of production
- Exercise managerial leverage
- Elicit an athlete's desire for peak performance

## Prerequisites
- Awareness of globalization trends
- Awareness of information revolution impacts

## Constraints
- Does not apply to environments with absolute job security (rare/non-existent)
- Requires proactive mindset and continuous effort

## Outcome
A proactive career management strategy focused on continuous value addition, adaptability, and competitive advantage retention to ensure long-term employability in a global economy.
