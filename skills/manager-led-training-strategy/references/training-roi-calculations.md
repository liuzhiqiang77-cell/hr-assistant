# Training ROI Calculations

## Detailed ROI Example: Technical Skills Training

### Scenario
- **Training**: Advanced Excel for Financial Analysts
- **Duration**: 4 hours (2 sessions)
- **Preparation**: 12 hours (3:1 ratio)
- **Students**: 15 financial analysts
- **Annual Work Hours per Student**: 2,000 hours
- **Total Student Hours**: 15 × 2,000 = 30,000 hours

### Investment
- **Manager Time**: 12 hours
- **Student Time**: 15 × 4 = 60 hours
- **Total Time Investment**: 72 hours

### Return
- **Expected Performance Improvement**: 2% (more efficient analysis, fewer errors)
- **Hours Gained**: 30,000 × 2% = 600 hours
- **ROI Ratio**: 600 / 72 = 8.3x return

### Financial Impact
- **Average Hourly Cost**: $75 (fully loaded)
- **Value of Hours Gained**: 600 × $75 = $45,000
- **Cost of Training**: 72 × $75 = $5,400
- **Net Benefit**: $39,600

## Training Volume Calculation Examples

### Example 1: High-Growth Startup

**Metrics**
- Annual Turnover: 25%
- Annual Growth: 50%

**Task 1 Load**
- Formula: 25% + 50% = 75%
- Interpretation: Must train 75% of staff annually on basics

**Task 2 Magnitude**
- Formula: 100% / 75% = 1.33x
- Interpretation: Training all staff is only 1.33x larger than new member training

**Decision**: Task 2 is feasible; proceed with organization-wide training

### Example 2: Stable Enterprise

**Metrics**
- Annual Turnover: 5%
- Annual Growth: 3%

**Task 1 Load**
- Formula: 5% + 3% = 8%
- Interpretation: Must train 8% of staff annually on basics

**Task 2 Magnitude**
- Formula: 100% / 8% = 12.5x
- Interpretation: Training all staff is 12.5x larger than new member training

**Decision**: Task 2 is massive; evaluate carefully before committing

**Cost Analysis**
- Staff: 1,000 employees
- One-day course cost: 1,000 × 8 hours × $100/hour = $800,000
- Question: Is the benefit worth $800,000+?
