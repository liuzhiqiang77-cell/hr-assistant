# Training ROI Calculator

## Basic ROI Formula

```
ROI = (Total Performance Gain - Training Cost) / Training Cost
```

## Detailed Calculation Steps

### Step 1: Calculate Training Cost

**Manager Preparation Time**:
```
Prep Hours = Course Hours × 3
```

**Student Time Cost**:
```
Student Cost = Number of Students × Course Hours × Hourly Rate
```

**Total Cost**:
```
Total Cost = (Prep Hours × Manager Hourly Rate) + Student Cost + Materials
```

### Step 2: Calculate Performance Gain

**Annual Work Hours**:
```
Annual Hours = Number of Students × 2,000 hours/year
```

**Performance Improvement**:
```
Gained Hours = Annual Hours × Improvement Percentage
```

**Value of Gained Hours**:
```
Value = Gained Hours × Average Hourly Value of Output
```

### Step 3: Calculate ROI

```
ROI = (Value - Total Cost) / Total Cost × 100
```

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Basic Skills Training

**Scenario**: Manager conducts 4-hour training on effective meetings for 8 team members

**Costs**:
- Manager prep: 4 × 3 = 12 hours × $100/hour = $1,200
- Student time: 8 × 4 hours × $50/hour = $1,600
- Materials: $200
- **Total Cost**: $3,000

**Benefits**:
- Annual work hours: 8 × 2,000 = 16,000 hours
- Improvement: 2% more effective meetings = 320 hours saved
- Value: 320 hours × $50/hour = $16,000

**ROI**:
```
ROI = ($16,000 - $3,000) / $3,000 × 100 = 433%
```

### Example 2: Technical Skills Training

**Scenario**: Manager conducts 8-hour training on new software for 12 engineers

**Costs**:
- Manager prep: 8 × 3 = 24 hours × $150/hour = $3,600
- Student time: 12 × 8 hours × $75/hour = $7,200
- Materials: $500
- **Total Cost**: $11,300

**Benefits**:
- Annual work hours: 12 × 2,000 = 24,000 hours
- Improvement: 5% productivity gain = 1,200 hours saved
- Value: 1,200 hours × $75/hour = $90,000

**ROI**:
```
ROI = ($90,000 - $11,300) / $11,300 × 100 = 697%
```

### Example 3: Large-Scale Management Training

**Scenario**: VP conducts 2-day training for 50 middle managers

**Costs**:
- VP prep: 16 × 3 = 48 hours × $300/hour = $14,400
- Student time: 50 × 16 hours × $100/hour = $80,000
- Materials: $5,000
- **Total Cost**: $99,400

**Benefits**:
- Annual work hours: 50 × 2,000 = 100,000 hours
- Improvement: 3% leadership effectiveness = 3,000 hours saved
- Value: 3,000 hours × $100/hour = $300,000

**ROI**:
```
ROI = ($300,000 - $99,400) / $99,400 × 100 = 202%
```

## Training Volume Calculator

### Task 1: New Member Training

```
Task 1 Load = Turnover Rate + Growth Rate
```

**Examples**:

| Organization | Turnover | Growth | Task 1 Load |
|--------------|----------|--------|------------|
| Stable Co. | 5% | 2% | 7% |
| Growing Co. | 15% | 20% | 35% |
| High Turnover | 40% | 5% | 45% |

### Task 2: New Skills Training

```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

**Examples**:

| Organization | Task 1 Load | Task 2 Magnitude |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Stable Co. | 7% | 14.3x |
| Growing Co. | 35% | 2.9x |
| High Turnover | 45% | 2.2x |

### Cost Implications

**For 100-employee organization, 2-day training**:

| Task | Employees | Days | Total Days | Cost at $500/day |
|------|-----------|------|------------|-------------------|
| Task 1 (7%) | 7 | 2 | 14 | $7,000 |
| Task 2 (100%) | 100 | 2 | 200 | $100,000 |

**For 100-employee organization, 5-day training**:

| Task | Employees | Days | Total Days | Cost at $500/day |
|------|-----------|------|------------|-------------------|
| Task 1 (7%) | 7 | 5 | 35 | $17,500 |
| Task 2 (100%) | 100 | 5 | 500 | $250,000 |
