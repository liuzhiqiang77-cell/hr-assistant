# Training Volume Calculator

## Step-by-Step Calculation

### Step 1: Gather Organizational Data
| Data Point | Your Value | Example |
|------------|------------|--------|
| Total Employees | ___ | 100 |
| Annual Turnover Rate | ___% | 10% |
| Annual Growth Rate | ___% | 10% |
| Average Annual Hours per Employee | ___ | 2,000 |

### Step 2: Calculate Task 1 Load (New Member Training)
```
Task 1 Load = Turnover Rate + Growth Rate
```

**Example:**
```
Task 1 Load = 10% + 10% = 20%
Employees needing training = 100 × 20% = 20 employees
```

### Step 3: Calculate Task 2 Magnitude (New Skill Training)
```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

**Example:**
```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / 20% = 5x
```

This means training ALL staff is 5 times more resource-intensive than training new hires.

### Step 4: Calculate Cost Implications

**Task 1 Cost (New Members):**
```
Employees to train = 20
Hours per employee = 40 hours (1 week training)
Total hours = 20 × 40 = 800 hours
Cost at $50/hour = $40,000
```

**Task 2 Cost (All Staff):**
```
Employees to train = 100
Hours per employee = 40 hours
Total hours = 100 × 40 = 4,000 hours
Cost at $50/hour = $200,000
```

**Task 2 is 5x more expensive than Task 1.**

### Step 5: Manager Preparation Time

**For a 1-hour course:**
```
Preparation time = 3 hours
Delivery time = 1 hour
Total manager time = 4 hours
```

**For a 40-hour course (1 week):**
```
Preparation time = 40 × 3 = 120 hours
Delivery time = 40 hours
Total manager time = 160 hours (4 full weeks)
```

## ROI Calculator

### Input Variables
| Variable | Your Value |
|----------|------------|
| Manager preparation hours | ___ |
| Manager delivery hours | ___ |
| Number of students | ___ |
| Annual hours per student | ___ |
| Expected performance improvement | ___% |

### Calculation
```
Total Manager Investment = Preparation + Delivery
Total Student Hours = Students × Annual Hours per Student
Total Gain = Total Student Hours × Performance Improvement%
ROI = Total Gain / Total Manager Investment
```

### Example
```
Manager Investment = 12 + 4 = 16 hours
Total Student Hours = 10 × 2,000 = 20,000 hours
Total Gain = 20,000 × 1% = 200 hours
ROI = 200 / 16 = 12.5x
```
