# Training Implementation Guide

## Preparation Checklist

### Before Training

- [ ] Identify specific skill gap or performance need
- [ ] Assess trainees' current capability level
- [ ] Allocate preparation time (3:1 ratio)
- [ ] Develop curriculum aligned with company culture
- [ ] Prepare practical examples and exercises
- [ ] Schedule consistent, recurring sessions

### During Training

- [ ] Establish yourself as practicing authority
- [ ] Connect training to real work situations
- [ ] Use examples from actual organizational experience
- [ ] Encourage questions and discussion
- [ ] Verify understanding through practice

### After Training

- [ ] Monitor application of new skills
- [ ] Provide coaching and reinforcement
- [ ] Measure performance improvement
- [ ] Calculate actual ROI
- [ ] Plan follow-up sessions as needed

## Cultural Alignment Assessment

### Before Designing Training

**Ask**:
1. How does work actually get done in this organization?
2. What are the unwritten rules and norms?
3. What management styles are valued?
4. How are decisions typically made?
5. What behaviors are rewarded or punished?

**Example: Intel Culture**
- **Values**: Constructive confrontation, data-driven decisions, meritocracy
- **Training approach**: Direct, practical, tied to real problems
- **Avoid**: Highly academic, theoretical, disconnected from practice

### Mismatch Warning Signs

- Participants seem disengaged or skeptical
- Training examples don't resonate
- Participants say "that's not how it works here"
- Training is seen as "HR requirement" not useful tool

## Training Volume Planning

### Annual Training Budget Example

**Organization**: 100 employees

**Metrics**:
- Turnover: 15%
- Growth: 5%
- Average salary: $80,000

**Task 1 (New Hires)**:
- Volume: 15% + 5% = 20% = 20 employees
- Training per new hire: 40 hours
- Total hours: 20 × 40 = 800 hours
- Cost: 800 × $40/hour = $32,000

**Task 2 (New Skills)**:
- Volume: 100 employees
- Training per employee: 8 hours
- Total hours: 100 × 8 = 800 hours
- Cost: 800 × $40/hour = $32,000

**Total training cost**: $64,000

**As percentage of payroll**: $64,000 / $8,000,000 = 0.8%

**Benchmark**: 2-4% of employee time = 2-4% of payroll

**Gap**: Need 2.5-4x more investment to reach benchmark

## ROI Tracking Template

| Training Program | Prep Hours | Delivery Hours | Student Hours | Total Cost | Measured Improvement | Hours Gained | ROI |
|------------------|------------|----------------|---------------|------------|---------------------|--------------|-----|
| Example | 12 | 4 | 40 | $2,400 | 5% | 1,000 | 417% |

**Calculation**:
- Total Cost = (Prep + Delivery) × Trainer rate + Student Hours × Student rate
- Hours Gained = Student Hours × Annual Hours × Improvement %
- ROI = (Hours Gained × Hourly Value) / Total Cost

## Common Training Mistakes

1. **Delegating to HR**: Manager must be the trainer
2. **One-time event**: Training must be ongoing process
3. **Cultural mismatch**: Teaching practices that don't match reality
4. **No ROI calculation**: Not measuring impact
5. **Insufficient preparation**: Not investing 3:1 prep ratio
6. **Theory over practice**: Too academic, not enough application
7. **No follow-up**: Not reinforcing and measuring application
