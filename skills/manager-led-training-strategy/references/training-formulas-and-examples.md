# Training Formulas and Detailed Examples

## ROI Calculation Details

### Variables
- `prep_ratio`: Hours of preparation per hour of course time (standard: 3)
- `total_student_hours`: Total annual work hours of the trained group
- `performance_improvement`: Efficiency gain achieved through training (e.g., 1%)

### Extended ROI Example
```
Scenario: Training 20 middle managers on strategic planning

Inputs:
- Course duration: 8 hours
- Preparation ratio: 3:1
- Manager preparation time: 8 × 3 = 24 hours
- Number of students: 20
- Annual work hours per student: 2,000 hours
- Total student hours: 20 × 2,000 = 40,000 hours
- Expected improvement: 2%

Calculation:
- Manager investment: 24 hours
- Organizational gain: 40,000 × 2% = 800 hours
- ROI: 800 / 24 = 33.3x return
```

## Training Volume Calculation Examples

### Example 1: High-Growth Startup
```
Annual Turnover Rate: 15%
Annual Growth Rate: 40%

Task 1 Load = 15% + 40% = 55%
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / 55% = 1.8x

Interpretation:
- More than half the staff needs basic training annually
- Training all staff is only 1.8x larger than new member training
- High growth makes Task 2 relatively more feasible
```

### Example 2: Stable Enterprise
```
Annual Turnover Rate: 5%
Annual Growth Rate: 3%

Task 1 Load = 5% + 3% = 8%
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / 8% = 12.5x

Interpretation:
- Only 8% of staff needs basic training annually
- Training all staff is 12.5x larger than new member training
- Task 2 requires significant resource commitment
```

## Cost Benchmarks

### Student Time Cost Calculation
```
Cost = Number of Students × Course Duration × Fully Burdened Hourly Rate

Example: One-day course for 50 middle managers
- Number of students: 50
- Course duration: 8 hours
- Fully burdened rate: $250/hour
- Cost = 50 × 8 × $250 = $100,000
```

### Intel Benchmark (Historical)
- One-day course for middle-management staff: >$1,000,000 in student time
- Reflects large organization with high compensation levels
