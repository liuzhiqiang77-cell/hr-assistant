# Manager-Led Training Strategy

## Manager's Training Responsibility

### Why Managers Must Train

1. **Define Manager's Output**: A manager's output is "the output of his organization—no more, no less."
2. **Performance Levers**: To increase individual performance, use two principal means:
   - Increasing motivation (desire to do the job well)
   - Increasing individual capability (via training)
3. **Non-delegation Principle**: Just as motivation cannot be fully delegated, neither should training be delegated solely to specialists.

### Who Should Train?

- The manager (you) must instruct direct subordinates and the next few ranks below them.
- **Rationale**: Training must be performed by a "suitable role model" who is a "believable, practicing authority."
- **Constraint**: Proxies, regardless of subject matter expertise, cannot fill this role effectively.

## High-Leverage Training ROI

### ROI Calculation Formula

**Example Scenario**:
- Preparation: 3 hours preparation per 1 hour course time
- Course: Series of 4 lectures (Total Manager Time = 12 hours)
- Scale: Train 10 students
- Impact Baseline: Students will work approximately 20,000 hours total next year

**Result**: If training yields a 1% performance improvement, the organization gains 200 hours of work (1% of 20,000) for a 12-hour investment.

### Key Variables

- `prep_ratio`: Hours of preparation per hour of course time (standard: 3)
- `total_student_hours`: Total annual work hours of the trained group
- `performance_improvement`: Efficiency gain achieved through training (e.g., 1%)

### Cultural Alignment

- Avoid "highly structured and academic" approaches if they contradict company practices.
- **Example**: If company tradition is a "free market" where employees apply for jobs on their own initiative, do not teach "carefully coordinated job rotations" or long-term career plans.
- **Warning**: Mismatch between teaching and practice demoralizes participants.

### Training as Process vs. Event

- Training must be a "process, not an event."
- Provide a "reliable, consistent presence" that is "systematic and scheduled."
- **Do not** use training as a "rescue effort summoned to solve the problem of the moment."

### Risks of Insufficient Training

Failure to train employees to recognize specific conditions leads to:
- Inefficiencies
- Excess costs
- Unhappy customers
- Danger

**Example**: An untrained operator operating an ion implanter caused >$1M in scrapped material and delivery slips.

## Training Strategy and Volume Assessment

### Establish Curriculum Scope (Benchmark)

- Maintain a catalogue of courses (e.g., Intel's "university catalogue" with 50+ classes).
- Cover range from basic skills (telephone manners) to complex technical skills (ion implanter operation ~200 hours).
- Include management disciplines (strategic planning, "constructive confrontation", performance reviews, productive meetings).
- Allocate approximately **2% to 4% of employee time** to classroom learning.

### Classify the Training Task

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Task 1: New Member Training | Teaching new members the skills needed to perform their jobs |
| Task 2: New Skill Training | Teaching new ideas, principles, or skills to present members |

### Calculate Training Volume

#### Task 1: New Members

```
Annual Training Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)
```

**Example**: A department with 10% turnover and 10% growth must train 20% of its staff annually.

#### Task 2: New Skills

```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

**Example**: If Task 1 load is 20%, Task 2 is 5 times larger (100% / 20%).

**Target**: 100% of the staff.

### Evaluate Cost and Feasibility

- Calculate cost based on student time.
- **Benchmark**: A one-day course for middle-management staff can cost over $1,000,000 in student time alone.
- **Decision Rule**: Do not enter into Task 2 (training all staff) lightly due to high magnitude and cost.

### Training Volume Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Annual Turnover Rate | Percentage | % of staff leaving annually |
| Annual Growth Rate | Percentage | % the organization grows annually |
| Task 1 Load | Percentage | % of staff requiring basic training (Turnover + Growth) |
| Task 2 Magnitude | Multiplier | Factor by which training all staff exceeds training new staff |

## When to Use This Skill

- Increasing organizational output
- Subordinates lack specific skills/capability
- New employee onboarding
- Introduction of new principles/skills
- Justifying training investments to leadership
- Planning annual training programs
