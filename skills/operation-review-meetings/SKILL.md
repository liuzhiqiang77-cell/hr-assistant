# Operation Review Meetings

## When to Use
- Managers from different organizational levels need to interact
- Topics require cross-level teaching and learning
- Junior managers need to present to senior supervisors
- No regular one-on-ones or staff meetings exist between levels

## When NOT to Use
- Immediate supervisor-subordinate one-on-ones
- Routine staff meetings
- Peer-level meetings

## Meeting Purpose
Facilitate teaching and learning between employees several organizational levels apart who lack regular interaction channels. This provides:
- Motivation for presenters to impress supervisors' supervisors and peers
- Opportunity for senior managers to gain detailed problem insights
- Platform for junior managers to receive feedback

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Organizing Manager (Supervisor)

**Preparation:**
- Decide what issues to discuss
- Determine level of detail for each topic
- Handle housekeeping (room, visuals, invitations)

**During Meeting:**
- Act as timekeeper
- Schedule presentations
- Keep presentations moving using inconspicuous gestures
- Prevent running out of time

### Reviewing Manager (Senior Supervisor)

**During Meeting:**
- Ask questions and make comments
- Impart the appropriate spirit
- Act as catalyst to provoke audience participation
- Encourage free expression by example
- Take the role seriously as a model for junior managers

**Critical Rule:**
- **NEVER preview the material**
- Ensures spontaneous reaction
- Models authentic engagement

### Presenters

**Preparation:**
- Use visual aids (overhead transparencies, slides)

**During Presentation:**

**During Meeting:**
- Participate actively by asking questions and making comments
- Avoid disengagement behaviors:
  - Avoiding eyes
  - Yawning
  - Reading newspaper or checking phone
- Correct factual errors publicly (it is your responsibility)
- Regard attendance as work, not a "siesta"

## Time Management

### Rule of Thumb Calculation
- **4 minutes** per visual aid (tables, numbers, graphics)
- Includes both presentation and discussion time

### Example
- 10 visual aids × 4 minutes = 40 minutes total
