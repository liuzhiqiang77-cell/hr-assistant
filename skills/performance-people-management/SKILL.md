description: Diagnose and address employee performance issues using the Can't/Won't framework, understand and mitigate the Peter Principle in promotion decisions, and apply team-based management principles. Use this skill when employees are underperforming, making promotion decisions, or building high-performing teams.

# Performance and People Management

## When to Use
- Employee is not performing job duties effectively
- Making promotion or hiring decisions
- Building or restructuring teams
- Addressing performance gaps
- Designing organizational hierarchy

## Employee Performance Diagnosis

### The Can't/Won't Framework

When an employee is not performing, the root cause is always one of two categories:

**Can't Do It** = Capability Issue
- Employee lacks the skills, knowledge, or ability
- Solution: **Train the employee**

**Won't Do It** = Motivation Issue
- Employee has the ability but lacks the will
- Solution: **Motivate the employee**

### Execution Steps

**Step 1: Identify Performance Gap**
- Observe specific behaviors or outputs that fall below expectations
- Document concrete examples
- Ensure role and expectations are clearly defined

**Step 2: Diagnose Root Cause**
- Ask: "Does the employee know HOW to do this?"
  - If NO → Can't do (Capability)
- Ask: "Does the employee WANT to do this?"
  - If NO → Won't do (Motivation)

**Step 3: Apply Correct Intervention**
- **For Can't Do**: Provide training, coaching, resources, or support
- **For Won't Do**: Provide motivation, incentives, accountability, or consequences

**Step 4: Monitor and Adjust**
- Track performance after intervention
- Reassess if diagnosis was correct
- Adjust approach if needed

### Critical Constraint
There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than **motivate** and **train**. All other interventions ultimately fall into these two categories.

## The Peter Principle

### Definition
"In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

### How It Works

**Step 1**: Selection based on current performance
- Candidate selected for position based on performance in current role
- Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"

**Step 2**: Promotion continues
- Employee promoted because they're successful in current role
- Pattern repeats with each promotion

**Step 3**: Incompetence reached
- Employee promoted to role where skills don't match requirements
- Performance declines or becomes inadequate
- Promotion stops

**Step 4**: Permanent placement
- Employee remains in role where they're incompetent
- "Managers rise to the level of their incompetence"

### Mitigation Strategies

**Strategy 1: Competency-Based Selection**
- Base promotion decisions on abilities required for NEW role
- Assess skills needed for future position, not past performance
- Use different criteria for different levels

**Strategy 2: Trial Periods**
- Test employee in higher-level responsibilities before promotion
- Assess fit for new role requirements
- Revert if performance inadequate

**Strategy 3: Dual Career Tracks**
- Provide advancement without management responsibilities
- Reward technical expertise with senior individual contributor roles
- Don't force good specialists into management

**Strategy 4: Skill Gap Analysis**
- Identify skills needed for next level
- Provide development before promotion
- Ensure readiness before advancement

## Management as a Team Game

### Core Principle
Management is explicitly defined as a **Team Game**.

### Implications

**1. Success is Collective**
- Management success depends on team effort, not individual prowess
- No manager succeeds alone
- Team performance is the ultimate measure

**2. Collaboration is Central**
- Coordination across team members essential
- Information sharing critical
- Silos undermine management effectiveness

**3. Interdependence**
- Each team member affects others' performance
- Manager's output = team's output
- Individual success tied to team success

### Application

**When Building Teams**:
- Assess how members work together, not just individual skills
- Consider team dynamics and collaboration styles
- Build complementary capabilities

**When Evaluating Managers**:
- Measure team output, not individual activity
- Assess ability to enable team success
- Evaluate collaboration and coordination effectiveness

**When Developing Leaders**:
- Teach team-building skills
- Emphasize collective over individual achievement
- Develop ability to work through others
