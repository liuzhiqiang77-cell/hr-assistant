# Task-Relevant Maturity Examples

## High TRM Scenarios
- A marketing director launching a new product campaign (10+ years experience)
- A production supervisor handling a routine process change

## Low TRM Scenarios
- A seasoned manager placed in a new department with unfamiliar processes
- An experienced engineer asked to lead a team for the first time
- A veteran salesperson dealing with a completely new market segment

## TRM Dynamics

TRM can change quickly based on:
- **Pace acceleration:** Job suddenly moves faster
- **Content shift:** New technology or methods introduced
- **Environmental change:** Different organizational unit or market conditions

Remember: TRM is specific to the task, not the person's overall ability or maturity.
