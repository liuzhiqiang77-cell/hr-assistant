# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) - Detailed Reference

## Definition
TRM is a combination of:
1. **Achievement orientation** - The degree to which the subordinate is driven to achieve
2. **Readiness to take responsibility** - Willingness to be accountable for outcomes
3. **Education, training, and experience** - Relevant background specific to the task

## Key Principle
TRM is **very specific to the task at hand**. It is entirely possible for a person to have high TRM in one job but low TRM in another.

## Dynamic Nature
TRM can change day by day or hour by hour, especially in fast-changing environments. Even seasoned managers may have low TRM if the environment, content, or tasks are new to them.

## Factors Causing Low TRM
- New environment
- Unfamiliar content
- New tasks
- Accelerated pace of work
- Abrupt job changes

## Distinguishing from General Competence
Do not confuse a manager's general competence and maturity with their task-relevant maturity. High general maturity does not guarantee high TRM in a new role.
