# Delegation Examples

## Example: Familiar vs. Unfamiliar Task Selection

**Scenario**: You need to delegate either:
- A) Preparing the monthly sales report (you've done this for 5 years)
- B) Coordinating the new product launch event (you've never done this)

**Decision**: Delegate the sales report.

**Reasoning**: You know what a good sales report looks like, can spot problems early, and provide meaningful feedback. The product launch is unfamiliar—you'd struggle to monitor effectively.

## Example: Lowest-Added-Value Monitoring

**Task**: Subordinate writing a technical specification document

**Poor approach**: Wait until final document is complete, then review
- Risk: Fundamental structural problems require complete rewrite
- Cost: Subordinate spent weeks on wrong approach

**Good approach**: Review outline after 1 day, then rough draft after 1 week
- Benefit: Catch structural issues early before significant investment
- Cost: Minimal time investment for early course correction

## Example: TRM-Based Monitoring Adjustment

**Task**: Quarterly budget preparation

**Month 1 (First delegation)**:
- Subordinate TRM: Low (never done this task)
- Monitoring: Daily check-ins, review each section as completed

**Month 2**:  
- Subordinate TRM: Growing (completed one successfully)
- Monitoring: Weekly check-ins, review draft at 50% completion

**Month 3**:
- Subordinate TRM: High (demonstrated competence)
- Monitoring: Single review of final draft before submission

## Example: Shared Values in Action

**Without shared values**:
- Manager: "Handle this customer complaint."
- Subordinate: Offers full refund without investigating (costs company $5,000)
- Manager: "That's not how we do things!"

**With shared values**:
- Manager: "Handle this customer complaint. Remember our principle: investigate first, resolve fairly, protect company interests."
- Subordinate: Investigates, finds product defect, offers replacement and apology (costs $200)
- Manager: "Good judgment."
