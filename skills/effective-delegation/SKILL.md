# Effective Delegation

Delegation without follow-through is abdication. You never wash your hands of the task; you remain responsible for its accomplishment.

## When to Use This Skill

- You need to free up time by assigning work to subordinates
- A subordinate is taking on a new task or responsibility
- You need to assess how closely to supervise a task
- You want to establish or strengthen a shared information base with your team

## Core Concepts

### Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

TRM is the combination of a subordinate's:
- Achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility
- Relevant education, training, and experience

**Critical distinction:** TRM is task-specific, not general. A person can have high TRM in one area and low TRM in another. TRM can change day-by-day based on job pace, environment changes, or new responsibilities.

### Operational Values

Effective delegation requires a shared understanding of:
- The correct way to do things
- Organizational priorities and preferences
- How the organization works together

Without shared operational values, you cannot delegate effectively—you remain accountable for all output.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Establish Shared Operational Values

Before delegating:
1. Ensure the subordinate understands your operational values, priorities, and preferences
2. Teach the subordinate how the organization works together
3. Do not allow subordinates to "pay tuition" through customer-impacting mistakes
4. Remember: The supervisor is accountable for teaching these values

### Step 2: Assess Subordinate's TRM for the Specific Task

Evaluate:
- How much experience does the subordinate have with this specific task?
- How have they performed on similar tasks previously?
- Has the task content, environment, or pace changed recently?

### Step 3: Select and Delegate Tasks

**Prerequisite:** Ensure you and the delegatee share a common information base and operational ideas.

**Task Selection Rule:** When given a choice, delegate activities that are familiar to you rather than unfamiliar ones.

**Reason:** It is easier to monitor tasks you know best.

**Avoid:** Insincere delegation where you emotionally hold onto tasks while pretending to delegate. If you keep a task because you enjoy it, make it a conscious decision rather than a charade.

### Step 4: Monitor Progress (Without Meddling)

Apply these quality assurance principles:

**Principle 1: Monitor at the Lowest-Added-Value Stage**
- Review rough drafts or early deliverables rather than waiting for polished final versions
- This catches basic content problems before expensive time is spent

**Principle 2: Use Sampling, Not 100% Inspection**
- Check enough details randomly to ensure satisfactory progress
- Don't check everything—that's 100% QA testing, not managerial monitoring

**Principle 3: Adjust Frequency Based on TRM**
- **Low TRM (newly delegated):** Monitor more frequently
- **High TRM (experienced):** Decrease monitoring intensity as work improves over time

### Step 5: Maintain Accountability

- You remain responsible for the task's accomplishment
- Follow through on delegated work
- Provide feedback and coaching as needed

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Letting subordinates "pay tuition"** through mistakes that impact customers
- **Insincere delegation**—pretending to delegate while emotionally holding on
- **Meddling**—prescribing specific activities instead of monitoring outcomes
- **Assuming general competence equals task competence**
