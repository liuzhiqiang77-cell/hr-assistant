# Performance Assessment

Use this skill to evaluate subordinate performance comprehensively, considering both current results and future capability building.

## When to Use

- Conducting performance reviews
- Evaluating subordinate contributions
- Making promotion or compensation decisions
- Assessing overall team or department health
- Providing feedback to subordinates

## Core Principles

1. **Define expectations in advance** - Ensure assessment against clear standards
2. **Balance output and internal measures** - Consider both current results and future capability
3. **Weighting is situational** - No strict formula; adjust based on context
4. **Explicit trade-offs** - Identify what is being traded off in the final assessment

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Define Expectations

Before assessment begins:

- Clarify what is expected from the subordinate
- Establish clear standards for evaluation
- Ensure subordinate understands expectations
- Document expectations for reference

### Step 2: Evaluate Output Measures (The Output of the Black Box)

Assess tangible results produced during the review period:

**Examples**:
- Completing designs on time
- Meeting sales quotas
- Increasing production yield
- Delivering projects within budget
- Achieving specific KPIs

**Characteristics**:
- Tangible and measurable
- Can be plotted on charts
- Direct contribution to current period results
- Clear cause-and-effect relationship

### Step 3: Evaluate Internal Measures (Inside the Black Box)

Assess activities that contribute to current output and build future capability:

**Current Period Activities**:
- Activities creating output for the current period
- Process improvements
- Problem-solving efforts
- Collaboration and support

**Future-Building Activities**:
- Positioning and developing people
- Ensuring department health to prevent future disgruntlement
- Building systems and processes
- Knowledge sharing and documentation
- Strategic thinking and planning

**Characteristics**:
- Often qualitative and intangible
- Harder to measure directly
- Impact may be delayed
- Critical for long-term success

### Step 4: Determine Weighting

Assign importance to each measure based on the situation:

**Factors to Consider**:
- Role and level of the subordinate
- Current business priorities
- Time horizon (short-term vs long-term focus)
- Organizational needs
- Specific circumstances of the review period

**Examples**:
- 50/50 split for balanced assessment
- 90/10 (output/internal) during crisis or urgent delivery phase
- 10/90 (output/internal) during transformation or building phase
- Weighting can shift monthly based on priorities

### Step 5: Trade-off Analysis

Explicitly identify what is being traded off:

- Which variables are being prioritized?
- What is being sacrificed in the assessment?
- Are the trade-offs aligned with organizational goals?
- Communicate trade-offs clearly to the subordinate

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Expectations defined and communicated in advance
- [ ] Output measures identified and quantified
- [ ] Internal measures identified and documented
- [ ] Weighting determined based on situation
- [ ] Trade-offs explicitly identified
- [ ] Assessment documented with rationale
- [ ] Feedback provided to subordinate

## Key Constraints

- Difficult to apply strictly objectively to professional work
- Requires judgment and contextual understanding
- Weighting is subjective and can vary
- Internal measures are harder to quantify
