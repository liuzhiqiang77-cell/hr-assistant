# Peter Principle Analysis

Identify and mitigate the phenomenon where managers rise to the level of their incompetence due to flawed promotion criteria.

## When to Use
- Designing or evaluating promotion systems
- Investigating underperformance in management roles
- Analyzing organizational structure and competency gaps
- Creating selection criteria for new positions

## Analysis Process

1. **Examine Selection Criteria**
   - Identify how candidates are selected for positions
   - Determine if selection is based on performance in current role
   - Check if abilities related to the intended role are evaluated

2. **Identify the Pattern**
   - If promotion is based on current success, employees continue to be promoted until they reach a role they are not skilled for
   - The employee stops being promoted once they are no longer competent
   - Result: "Managers rise to the level of their incompetence"

3. **Assess Organizational Impact**
   - Count positions filled by individuals who may have reached their incompetence level
   - Evaluate the cost of having incompetent managers in key roles
   - Consider the effect on team morale and performance

## Mitigation Strategies

- Base selection on competencies specific to the intended role, not current performance
- Use assessment centers or simulations to test skills required for the new position
- Provide training and development before promotion, not after
- Create dual career tracks (technical vs. managerial) to avoid promoting skilled individual contributors into management roles they're unsuited for

## Constraints
- Does not apply if selection is based on competencies specific to the intended role
- Does not apply if skills required for the new role are identical to the current role
