# Performance Diagnosis Examples

## Life or Death Test Examples

### Example 1: Sales Representative Not Meeting Quota
**Situation**: Sales rep consistently below quota
**Question**: "If their life depended on making 50 calls per day, could they do it?"
- **YES**: They have the skills but lack motivation → Apply motivational strategies
- **NO**: They don't know how to make effective calls → Provide sales training

### Example 2: Engineer Failing to Write Code
**Situation**: Engineer not delivering code modules
**Question**: "If their life depended on writing this module, could they do it?"
- **YES**: Capable but unmotivated → Motivation issue
- **NO**: Lacks technical competence → Training issue

## Task-Relevant Maturity Examples

### Immature Employee Scenario
**Employee**: New hire, 2 weeks into role
**Task**: Quarterly revenue forecast
**Management Style**: Hands-on training
**Action**: Review each assumption, provide template, check calculations before submission
**Why**: If they get it wrong, the entire company makes bad decisions - customers (investors) pay the price

### Mature Employee Scenario
**Employee**: 5-year veteran, expert in forecasting
**Task**: Quarterly revenue forecast
**Management Style**: Delegate
**Action**: Set due date, review final output for reasonableness
**Why**: Employee has demonstrated competence; micromanaging reduces their autonomy

## Time Offset Examples

### Manufacturing Setup (6-month project)
**Review period**: Jan-Jun
**Activities**: Designed new production line, ordered equipment, trained staff
**Visible output**: Nothing operational yet
**Assessment**: Give high performance rating for strong activities
**Present value calculation**: New line will increase capacity by 30% for next 5 years = significant current value despite zero immediate output

### Research Project (2-year horizon)
**Review period**: Jan-Jun
**Activities**: Literature review, experimental design, early trials
**Visible output**: Paper drafts, no commercial product
**Assessment**: Credit for research activities and progress milestones

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Assessing general maturity instead of task-relevant maturity**: An expert engineer may be immature at giving presentations
2. **Ignoring time offset**: Penalizing employees for "no results" when they're building long-term infrastructure
3. **Allowing "learn by mistakes" for critical tasks**: Only acceptable in sandbox environments, never with customers
