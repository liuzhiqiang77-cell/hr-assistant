description: Diagnose the root cause of performance issues (capability vs motivation), determine appropriate management style based on task-relevant maturity, and account for time offset in performance assessment. Use when an employee is not performing and you need to understand why and decide on the appropriate managerial intervention.

# Performance Diagnosis Framework

This skill provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing performance issues and selecting appropriate management responses.

## When to Use
- An employee, team member, or subordinate is not performing their job
- You need to decide between hands-on or hands-off management for a specific task
- Reviewing performance where results lag behind activities (long-term projects, infrastructure work)

## Diagnostic Workflow

### Step 1: Diagnose Performance Failure (Can't vs Won't)

Apply the "Life or Death" Mental Test:

1. Ask yourself: "If the person's life depended on doing the work, could he do it?"

2. Determine the root cause:
   - **YES** answer: The person is capable but NOT motivated → **Won't do it** (Motivation issue)
   - **NO** answer: The person is NOT capable → **Can't do it** (Capability issue)

3. Select intervention:
   - For **Can't do it**: Use Training
   - For **Won't do it**: Use Motivation strategies

> **Note**: These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job.

### Step 2: Assess Task-Relevant Maturity

Determine the appropriate management style based on the employee's maturity level for the **specific task at hand**:

| Maturity Level | Management Style | Critical Constraint |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Immature | Hands-on Training | **Do NOT** allow "learn by mistakes" - customers pay for failures |
| Mature | Delegate (hands-off) | Employee takes ownership of results |

### Step 3: Account for Time Offset

When performance has delayed results:

1. **Identify time offset**: Determine if output in the review period reflects activities from the same period or earlier work (like "light from distant stars")

2. **Judge based on activities**:
   - Give credit for strong activities even if tangible output is absent
   - Do not penalize for lack of immediate output if building future capacity

3. **Apply Present Value concept**:
   - Estimate how much future-oriented activity will pay back over time
   - Determine what that future value is worth today to decide current significance

## Key Principles

- Performance assessment is task-specific, not person-specific
- Management style must match task-relevant maturity, not general competence
- Time offset analysis requires judgment beyond simple metrics
- "Learn by mistakes" is unacceptable when customers bear the cost
