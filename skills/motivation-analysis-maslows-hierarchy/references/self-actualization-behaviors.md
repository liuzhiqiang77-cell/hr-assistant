# Self-Actualization Behaviors

## Competence-Driven Behaviors
- **Focus**: Job or task mastery
- **Observable actions**:
  - Sharpening own skill continuously
  - Trying to do better than previous attempt
  - Seeking feedback to improve
  - Practicing deliberately
- **Examples**:
  - Violinist practicing daily for hours
  - Teenager perfecting skateboard trick
  - Programmer refactoring code for elegance

## Achievement-Driven Behaviors
- **Focus**: Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors
- **Observable actions**:
  - Testing limits of capability
  - Working at "boundary of capability"
  - Seeking increasingly difficult challenges
  - Measuring success against personal standards
- **Behavioral Classification (Peg/Ring Experiment)**:
  - **Gamblers**: High risk, no influence on outcome (NOT achievers)
  - **Conservatives**: Very little risk (NOT achievers)
  - **Achievers**: Challenge at boundary of capability to test limits

## Common Characteristics
- Both types spontaneously test outer limits of abilities
- Both require appropriate challenge level
- Both benefit from feedback on performance
- Both are self-reinforcing (success breeds more effort)

## Management Implications
- **If spontaneous**: Provide resources and get out of the way
- **If not spontaneous**: Use MBO with 50% success probability goals
- **Culture must**: Value output over knowledge, results over intentions
