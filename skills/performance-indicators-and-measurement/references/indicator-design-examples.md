## Linearity Analysis Template

```
Month: April of 6-month target
Target: 100 hires by September
Ideal Progress: 6 months = 100 hires → 16.7 hires/month
April should have: 4 × 16.7 = 66.8 hires
Actual: 40 hires

Gap: 26.8 hires behind
Remaining: 60 hires in 2 months = 30 hires/month required
(80% increase in hiring rate needed)
