# Performance Indicators and Measurement

Use this skill when designing performance metrics, monitoring daily operations, or tracking progress toward deadlines and monthly goals.

## When to Use
- Starting daily operations or arriving at the office
- Designing or selecting performance metrics for a team or process
- Monitoring progress toward a deadline or monthly target
- Identifying performance trends that require corrective action
- Balancing competing objectives (e.g., speed vs. quality)

## Daily Operational Indicator Set

Review these indicators daily to ensure operations stay on track:

### 1. Sales Forecast
- **What**: Number of units planned for delivery today
- **Action**: Set production targets and resource allocation

### 2. Variance Analysis
- **What**: Difference between yesterday's actual deliveries vs. planned deliveries
- **Action**: Assess confidence in today's forecast; adjust if variance is significant

### 3. Raw Material Inventory
- **What**: Current stock levels of essential items
- **Actions**:
  - IF too low: Order more supplies immediately
  - IF too high: Cancel scheduled deliveries

### 4. Equipment Condition
- **What**: Operational state of production machinery
- **Action**: IF breakdown occurred, arrange repairs or rearrange production line

### 5. Manpower Status
- **What**: Available staff vs. required staff
- **Actions**:
  - IF understaffed: Call in temporary help OR reallocate staff from other lines

### 6. Quality Indicator
- **What**: Customer complaint count per staff member
- **Action**: IF a waiter elicited more than usual complaints, speak to that waiter immediately

## Principles of Effective Indicator Design

### Core Principles

1. **Attention Principle**: Indicators direct attention like steering a bicycle—"you will probably steer it where you are looking."

2. **Guard Against Overreaction**: Focusing on a single metric can lead to extreme behaviors (e.g., driving inventory too low creates shortages).

3. **Implement Paired Indicators**: Always pair indicators to measure both the "effect" and the "counter-effect" to maintain the "optimum middle ground."

### Paired Indicator Examples

| Primary Metric | Counter Metric | Prevents |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Inventory Levels | Incidence of Shortages | Over-reduction causing stockouts |
| Completion Date | Capability | Rushing or perfectionism |
| # Vouchers Processed | # Errors Found | Speed over accuracy |
| # Square Feet Cleaned | Quality Rating | Quantity over quality |

### Administrative Indicator Criteria

**Rule 1**: Any measurement is better than none.

**Rule 2**: Measure **Output** (results), not **Activity** (effort).
- Good: Orders obtained, items shipped
- Bad: Calls made, hours worked

**Rule 3**: Measure **Physical/Countable** things.
- Examples: Vouchers processed, square feet cleaned, sales orders entered, transactions processed, people hired, items managed

### Administrative Pairing Strategy

Always pair Quantity/Output indicators with Quality indicators:

**Accounts Payable**:
- Primary: # Vouchers processed
- Counter: # Errors found

**Custodial**:
- Primary: # Square feet cleaned
- Counter: Quality rating by senior manager

## Linearity Indicator Analysis

### Purpose

Provides an "early warning" to allow time for corrective action before the deadline passes.

### Procedure

1. **Plot Actual Progress**: Graph actual output achieved against time elapsed (e.g., Number of acceptances vs. Month)

2. **Define Ideal Straight Line**: A linear trajectory from the starting point (zero or baseline) to the final target at the deadline

3. **Compare Actual vs. Ideal**:
   - **Below Line**: Calculate required rate for remaining period. Indicator signals much higher rate needed to hit target.
   - **Back-Loaded**: Output concentrated in last week/month rather than spread evenly. Indicates inefficient resource use.

4. **Take Action**:
   - IF below line: Take immediate corrective action to accelerate performance
   - IF back-loaded: Address resource allocation to prevent missing goals due to potential breakdowns

### Example Scenarios

**Recruiting**: If in April you have 40% of target hires but should have 67% (4 months of 6-month timeline), you need 60% more hires per month for remaining 2 months.

**Manufacturing**: If 80% of monthly output occurs in the last week, equipment and manpower are underutilized earlier in the month.

## Indicator Design Procedure

1. **Identify Objectives**: What outcomes matter?
2. **Select Primary Metrics**: Choose countable output measures
3. **Design Counter Metrics**: Add opposing measures to prevent over-optimization
4. **Set Targets**: Define ideal performance levels
5. **Implement Tracking**: Establish data collection and reporting
6. **Monitor Linearity**: Track progress over time against ideal trajectory
7. **Review and Adjust**: Refine indicators based on observed behavior
