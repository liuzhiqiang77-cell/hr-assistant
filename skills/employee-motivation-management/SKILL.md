# Employee Motivation Management

## When to Use
- Improving team or individual performance
- Managing high-potential or creative employees
- Designing motivation systems for knowledge workers
- Creating competitive environments to drive performance
- Addressing motivation-related performance issues

## Core Principle
**Motivation must come from within.** Managers cannot directly motivate people; they can only create environments where motivated people flourish.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Determine the Worker Type
- **Manual Labor**: Output is measurable; fear-based motivation can work
- **Knowledge Workers**: Output is hard to measure; humanistic approaches required

### Step 2: Choose Management Approach

#### Approach A: Environmental Design (Foundation)
1. Focus on performance outcomes, not attitudes
2. Create conditions that enable motivated behavior
3. Remove barriers to performance
4. Ensure basic needs (physiological, safety) are met

#### Approach B: Self-Actualization Management (High Performers)
1. **Identify Driver Type**:
   - Competence-driven: Focus on task mastery
   - Achievement-driven: Focus on testing limits

2. **Set Stretch Goals (MBO System)**:
   - Set objectives with ~50% chance of success
   - Goals should be at the "boundary of capability"
   - Even failed attempts at difficult goals produce higher output

3. **Build Output-Centered Culture**:
   - Value tangible results over abstract knowledge
   - Recognize and reward actual achievement
   - Avoid "knowledge-centered" cultures where knowing is valued over doing

#### Approach C: Competitive Sports Management
1. **Establish the Arena**:
   - Create clear rules and metrics
   - Enable self-measurement against peers
   - Example: Scorecards, rankings, comparative metrics

2. **Adopt the Coach Role**:
   - Take no personal credit for team success
   - Be tough and critical to push for personal best
   - Steer focus to task-relevant feedback

3. **Manage Fear and Failure**:
   - Shift fear from "job loss" to "failure to perform"
   - Normalize failure as statistical probability (50% in competition)
   - Prevent conservative risk-avoidance

### Step 3: Monitor and Adjust
- Watch for removal of competition (causes motivation to vanish)
- Adjust goal difficulty based on performance
- Balance fear of failure with encouragement to take risks

## Output
A motivation management strategy tailored to worker type and performance objectives.
