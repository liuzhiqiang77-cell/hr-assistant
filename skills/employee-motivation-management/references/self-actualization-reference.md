# Self-Actualization - Detailed Reference

## Key Characteristics

### Unlike Other Motivation Sources
- Does not extinguish after needs are fulfilled
- Drives performance to ever higher levels
- Both competence-driven and achievement-driven types spontaneously test outer limits of ability

## Driver Types

### Competence-Driven
- **Focus**: Job or task mastery
- **Behavior**: Sharpening own skill, trying to do better than the time before
- **Examples**: 
  - A violinist practicing daily
  - A teenager perfecting a skateboard trick
  - A craftsman refining their technique

### Achievement-Driven
- **Focus**: Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors
- **Behavior**: Testing the limits of capability; working at the "boundary of their capability"
- **Behavioral Classification** (based on peg/ring experiment):
  - **Gamblers**: High risk, no influence on outcome
  - **Conservatives**: Very little risk
  - **Achievers**: Challenge themselves at the boundary of capability to test limits

## MBO System Implementation

### Goal Success Probability
- **Target**: ~50% chance of achieving objectives, even with maximum effort
- **Rationale**: Output tends to be greater when striving for a level beyond immediate grasp
- **Outcome**: Even if failure occurs half the time, peak performance is achieved

### Cultural Environment Types

**Knowledge-Centered Culture**:
- Knowing abstractly is valued over producing results
- Leads to low actual achievement
- Example: Academic environments where theory trumps practice

**Output-Centered Culture**:
- Tangible results are highly valued and esteemed
- Abstract knowledge without application gets little recognition
- Drives actual achievement and performance
- Required for self-actualization to flourish
