# Behavioral Classification: The Peg/Ring Experiment

## Background
An experiment classified individuals based on their risk-taking behavior in a ring-toss game.

## Three Behavioral Types

### Gamblers
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Influence on Outcome**: None (pure chance)
- **Motivation**: Thrill of risk, not achievement
- **Management Implication**: Not suitable for achievement-driven roles

### Conservatives
- **Risk Level**: Very low
- **Behavior**: Avoid challenge, stay within comfort zone
- **Motivation**: Security and safety
- **Management Implication**: Suitable for routine, stable tasks

### Achievers
- **Risk Level**: Moderate
- **Influence on Outcome**: High (skill matters)
- **Behavior**: Challenge themselves at the boundary of capability
- **Motivation**: Testing limits, personal best
- **Management Implication**: Ideal for self-actualization and peak performance

## Application
When managing for self-actualization, identify and nurture "Achievers" by providing challenges at their capability boundary.
