# Management by Objectives (MBO) Implementation

## Goal Setting Principles

### The 50% Rule

Set objectives at a difficulty level where the individual has only a "fifty-fifty chance" of making them, even if they push hard.

**Rationale**: Output tends to be greater when striving for a level beyond immediate grasp, even if failure occurs half the time.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Specific, measurable outcomes
2. **Assess Capability**: Ensure goals are at the boundary of current ability
3. **Set Probability Target**: Aim for ~50% success rate
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track without micromanaging
5. **Review and Adjust**: Calibrate difficulty based on performance

## Driver Type Identification

### Competence-Driven

**Focus**: Job or task mastery

**Behaviors**:
- Sharpening own skill
- Trying to do better than the time before
- Example: A violinist practicing daily

### Achievement-Driven

**Focus**: Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors

**Behaviors**:
- Testing limits of capability
- Working at the "boundary of their capability"

**Behavioral Classification (Peg/Ring Experiment)**:
- **Gamblers**: High risk, no influence on outcome
- **Conservatives**: Very little risk
- **Achievers**: Challenge themselves at the boundary of capability to test limits

## Culture Design

### Output-Centered Culture

**Characteristics**:
- Tangible results are highly valued and esteemed
- Abstract knowledge without application gets little recognition
- Performance is the primary metric of success

**Benefits**:
- Higher actual achievement
- Clear performance expectations
- Motivation tied to results

### Knowledge-Centered Culture (Avoid)

**Characteristics**:
- Knowing abstractly is valued over producing results
- Theoretical knowledge is prized
- Low actual achievement despite high "knowledge"

**Risks**:
- Low tangible output
- Motivation disconnected from results
- Difficulty measuring real contribution
