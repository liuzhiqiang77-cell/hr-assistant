# Employee Motivation Management - Detailed Reference

## Work Type Considerations

### Manual Labor
- **Characteristics**: Output readily measurable, tasks clearly defined
- **Historical Approach**: Fear of punishment (loss of life/food) was effective
- **Example**: Galley slaves driven by fear
- **Modern Application**: Clear metrics, immediate feedback on output

### Knowledge Workers
- **Characteristics**: Output difficult to measure immediately, expectations hard to state precisely
- **Challenge**: "Fear won't work as well with computer architects as with galley slaves"
- **Requirement**: Humanistic approaches focused on intrinsic motivation
- **Example**: Software engineers, researchers, designers

## Self-Actualization Driver Types

### Competence-Driven
**Focus**: Job or task mastery

**Behaviors**:
- Sharpening own skills continuously
- Trying to do better than previous attempts
- Perfecting techniques and methods

**Examples**:
- Violinist practicing scales daily
- Craftsman refining joinery techniques
- Programmer learning new algorithms

### Achievement-Driven
**Focus**: Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors

**Behaviors**:
- Testing limits of capability
- Working at "boundary of capability"
- Seeking challenges that may result in failure

**Behavioral Classification (Peg/Ring Experiment)**:
- **Gamblers**: High risk, no influence on outcome
- **Conservatives**: Very little risk, avoid failure
- **Achievers**: Challenge at boundary of capability to test limits

**Commonality**: Both types spontaneously try to test outer limits of abilities

## MBO Goal Setting Guidelines

### Target Difficulty
- **Success Probability**: 50% even with maximum effort
- **Rationale**: 
  - Output tends to be greater when striving beyond immediate grasp
  - Even if failure occurs half the time, overall performance increases
  - Prevents complacency from easy goals
  - Prevents demotivation from impossible goals

### Implementation Steps
1. Define clear, measurable objectives
2. Assess current capability level
3. Set goal requiring stretch beyond current level
4. Provide resources and support
5. Monitor progress and adjust as needed

## Culture Design

### Output-Centered Culture
**Characteristics**:
- Tangible results are highly valued and esteemed
- Abstract knowledge without application gets little recognition
- Performance is visible and measurable
- Achievement is celebrated publicly

**Benefits**:
- Aligns with self-actualization drivers
- Creates clear success criteria
- Motivates through achievement recognition

### Knowledge-Centered Culture (Avoid)
**Characteristics**:
- Knowing abstractly is valued over producing results
- Expertise is recognized regardless of output
- Theoretical knowledge is prized

**Risks**:
- Low actual achievement
- Motivation misaligned with organizational goals
- Difficulty measuring real contribution

## Constraints
- Assumes basic physiological and safety needs are met (Maslow's hierarchy)
- Not applicable for routine tasks requiring no creativity or stretch
- Requires manager to accept some failure as part of growth process
