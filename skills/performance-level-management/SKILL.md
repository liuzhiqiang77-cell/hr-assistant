description: Manage employees at different performance extremes using targeted strategies for poor performers requiring turnaround (the "Blast" process) and high achievers needing continued development. Use when an employee has major performance problems or when developing top performers.

# Performance Level Management

## When to Use
- An employee has major performance problems requiring turnaround to avoid firing
- A subordinate is a high achiever who needs continued development
- Conducting performance reviews for extreme performers (very poor or very good)

## The "Blast" Performance Review Process (Poor Performers)

### Prerequisites
- Manager possesses facts and examples
- Subordinate is at risk of termination unless performance improves

### Step 1: Identify Current Stage in Resistance Cycle
Track which stage the subordinate is in:
1. **Ignore** - Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny** - Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others** - Admits problem exists but blames others
4. **Assume Responsibility** - Admits "It is my problem"
5. **Find Solution** - Intellectual step to remedy the situation

### Step 2: Facilitate Progression Through Stages

**Ignore → Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality

**Deny → Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance

**Blame Others → Assume Responsibility** (The Critical Step):
- This is an **emotional step** (hard)
- Guide subordinate to realize: "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
- This implies work and unpleasantness

**Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**:
- This is an **intellectual step** (easier)
- Finding solution becomes a shared task

### Step 3: Evaluate Possible Outcomes
- **Outcome 1**: Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
- **Outcome 2**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
- **Outcome 3**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Step 4: Execute Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at "Blame Others")
1. Assume formal role of supervisor with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do"
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right"
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do"
5. Secure subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

### Constraint
Process cannot proceed to solution-finding if subordinate is stuck in denial or blame stages

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### Prerequisites
- Performance review process initiated
- Subordinate identified as high performer

### Step 1: Analyze Current Review Content
- Is it purely retrospective assessment (analyzing past year)?
- Is it focused on justifying a high rating?

### Step 2: Recognize Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better.

### Step 3: Contrast with Poor Performers
- Poor performers receive detailed "corrective action programs"
- High achievers often lack future-oriented guidance

### Step 4: Shift Priority
Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to:
- Improve performance further
- Maintain current high level

### Rationale
High achievers account for disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a "high-leverage activity" with great impact on group output.

### Constraint
Does not apply to poor performers who require corrective action programs
