# Employee Performance and Career Management

## When to Use This Skill
- Addressing employee underperformance
- Making promotion or hiring decisions
- Developing personal career strategy
- Managing talent in slow/no-growth environments
- Coaching employees on career advancement

## Part 1: Employee Performance Diagnosis

### When to Diagnose
- Employee is not performing their job duties
- Performance is below expectations
- Output is not meeting standards

### Diagnosis Framework

**Step 1: Identify the Problem**
- Confirm the employee is not doing their job
- Define what "doing the job" means (clear expectations required)

**Step 2: Categorize the Root Cause**

Ask: Is the issue **capability** or **motivation**?

| Category | Question | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Can't do it** | Capability | Employee lacks the skill, knowledge, or ability |
| **Won't do it** | Motivation | Employee has the ability but lacks the drive |

**Step 3: Select the Intervention**

- **If Can't do (Capability)**: Train the employee
- **If Won't do (Motivation)**: Motivate the employee

**Critical Constraint**: There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train.

### Common Mistakes
- Assuming motivation when it's actually capability
- Providing training when the issue is motivation
- Failing to clarify expectations before diagnosing

## Part 2: The Peter Principle

### When to Apply
- Making promotion decisions
- Evaluating promotion criteria
- Designing career progression systems
- Assessing why managers may be underperforming in new roles

### The Principle

**Definition**: "In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

**Mechanism**:
1. Selection for a position is based on performance in the current role
2. Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"
3. Employee continues to be promoted until reaching a role they are not skilled for
4. Employee stops being promoted once no longer competent
5. Result: "Managers rise to the level of their incompetence"

### Variables
- **Current Role Performance**: Success in existing position
- **Intended Role Abilities**: Skills required for the new position

### How to Avoid the Peter Principle

1. **Base promotions on intended role competencies**, not just current performance
2. **Assess skills required for the new role** independently
3. **Provide transitional training** before promotion
4. **Use trial periods** in the new role
5. **Consider lateral moves** that build required skills

### When the Principle Explains Performance
- Manager was excellent in previous role but struggles in current role
- Performance decline coincides with promotion
- Skills that made someone successful don't translate to new level

## Part 3: Sole Proprietor Career Management Mindset

### When to Apply
- Managing your own career
- Coaching employees on career development
- Navigating organizational changes
- Planning long-term employability

### The Mindset

**Core Principle**: You are not an employee; you are a business with one employee: yourself.

**Key Realities**:
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- Fellow workers are not primary rivals (outnumbered 1000:1 to 1,000,000:1 by people at competing organizations)
- "Nobody owes you a career"—you own it as a sole proprietor

### Daily Career Management Actions

1. **Retain competitive advantage**
2. **Enhance your value every day**
3. **Hone your competitive advantage**
4. **Learn and adapt constantly**
5. **Be willing to move** from job to job or industry to industry
6. **Retrench if necessary** to start again

**Goal**: Manage your career to avoid becoming a casualty of globalization and the information revolution.

### The 3 Self-Assessment Questions

**Question 1: Value Addition**
- Ask: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"
- Action: Continually look for ways to make things truly better
- Principle: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization"
- Standard: Every hour should increase the output or value of the people you're responsible for

**Question 2: Connectivity**
- Ask: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"
- Check: Inside the company AND the industry
- Don't wait for supervisor to interpret events
- Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people"

**Question 3: Innovation**
- Ask: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"
- Action: Personally try new things; don't just read about them
- Warning: Don't wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of it

### Addressing Internal Threats

**The Threat**: Ambitious junior employees who desire upward movement but are blocked by your position in slow/no-growth environments.

**The Boss's Dilemma**: Choosing between retaining you (doing good job but blocking others) or promoting the junior.

**Your Responsibility**: Avoid being "in the way"—move up or move on.

### Apply Productivity Principles
- Apply methods of production to your work
- Exercise managerial leverage
- Elicit an athlete's desire for peak performance
