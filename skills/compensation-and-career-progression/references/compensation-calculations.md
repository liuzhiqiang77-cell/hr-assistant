# Compensation Calculation Examples

## Bonus Calculation Example

**Scenario:** Middle Manager with $100,000 total compensation

**Step 1: Determine Bonus Pool**
- Target: 20% of total compensation
- Bonus Pool = $100,000 × 20% = $20,000

**Step 2: Apply 3-Factor Split**
| Factor | Weight | Amount |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Individual Performance | 50% | $10,000 |
| Team Performance | 30% | $6,000 |
| Corporate Performance | 20% | $4,000 |

**Step 3: Apply Performance Multipliers**
| Rating | Individual Multiplier | Team Result | Corporate Result |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Exceeds | 1.5x | $6,000 × 1.2 = $7,200 | $4,000 × 1.1 = $4,400 |
| Meets | 1.0x | $6,000 × 1.0 = $6,000 | $4,000 × 1.0 = $4,000 |
| Below | 0.5x | $6,000 × 0.8 = $4,800 | $4,000 × 0.9 = $3,600 |

**Total Bonus Calculation (Exceeds Example):**
- Individual: $10,000 × 1.5 = $15,000
- Team: $6,000 × 1.2 = $7,200
- Corporate: $4,000 × 1.1 = $4,400
- **Total: $26,600**

## Salary Curve Comparison

**Scenario:** Two employees starting at $50,000

| Year | Employee A (High Performer) | Employee B (Average) | Difference |
|------|----------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| 0 | $50,000 | $50,000 | $0 |
| 1 | $55,000 | $52,000 | $3,000 |
| 2 | $61,000 | $54,500 | $6,500 |
| 3 | $68,000 | $57,500 | $10,500 |
| 4 | $76,000 | $61,000 | $15,000 |
| 5 | $85,000 | $65,000 | $20,000 |

After 5 years, the high performer earns 31% more due to compounding differences in raises.
