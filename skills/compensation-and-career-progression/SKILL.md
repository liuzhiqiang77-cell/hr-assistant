description: Design compensation systems for middle and senior managers (base salary + performance bonus), understand the promotion performance cycle (exceeds requirements triggers promotion), and handle situations where promoted employees struggle through employee recycling. Use when designing compensation structures, evaluating employees for promotion, or managing underperforming promoted employees.

# Compensation and Career Progression

## When to Use This Skill
- Designing or reviewing compensation structures for managers
- Evaluating employees for promotion eligibility
- Managing employees who are struggling after promotion
- Determining bonus allocations and salary adjustments

## Design Performance Bonus (Variable Pay)

### Determine Bonus Percentage

- **Middle Manager**: 10% to 25% of total compensation
- **Senior Manager**: Up to 50% of total compensation

**Reasoning**: Higher earners have less material utility for incremental dollars; higher percentage needed for feedback while avoiding hardship from fluctuations.

### Define Bonus Factors

Identify if performance is Team-based or Individual-based, then define the team scope:

**Recommended 3-Factor Split** (e.g., for 20% total comp):
1. Individual Performance (judged by supervisor)
2. Immediate Team Objective Performance (e.g., department)
3. Overall Corporate Financial Performance

### Establish Timing

- Pay bonus close enough to the work time so the subordinate remembers why it was awarded
- Account for cause/effect time offsets

### Select Metrics

- **Countable items**: Financial metrics
- **Measurable objectives**: Specific KPIs
- **Subjective elements**: Use with caution (may lead to "beauty contest")

## Design Salary Administration (Base Pay)

### Select Administration Scheme

**Option A: Experience-Only** (Easiest)
- Pay based strictly on time (X time = Y pay)
- Ignores merit

**Option B: Merit-Only** (Impractical)
- Hard to ignore experience

**Option C: Compromise** (Recommended - "Family of curves")
- Starts everyone at same salary level
- Individuals move up at different speeds/arrive at different places based on performance
- Shape approximates experience-only curve but allows variance

### Implement Competitive Ranking

- Accept that merit-based systems require competitive, comparative evaluation
- Principle: If someone is first, someone else must be last (similar to sports rankings)

## Promotion Performance Cycle

### The Cycle Logic

1. **Initial State**: Employee at Job 1 performing at "meets requirements" (average level)
2. **Improvement Phase**: With training and motivation, performance improves to "exceeds requirements" (above-average)
3. **Promotion Trigger**: Once "exceeds requirements", employee is "promotable" and promoted to Job 2
4. **Performance Reset**: Upon entering Job 2, employee initially performs at "meets requirements" due to new challenges
5. **Cycle Repetition**: With experience, employee improves to "exceeds requirements", leading to another promotion
6. **Cycle Conclusion**: Cycle repeats until employee settles at "meets requirements" and is no longer promoted

### Critical Constraint

If an employee "exceeds the requirements" but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will **atrophy** and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements".

## Employee Recycling Procedure

### When to Use

- Employee has been promoted
- Employee is performing below-average for extended period
- Employee was previously successful in their prior role

### Execution Steps

1. **Identification**: Recognize the person has been promoted "so much over his head" that they perform below-average
2. **Solution Selection**: Choose to "recycle" rather than terminate
3. **Definition**: Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion
4. **Management Accountability**: Admit management was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness"
5. **Implementation**: Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do
6. **Support System**: Support the employee in the face of likely embarrassment
7. **Transparency**: Execute recycling "openly" to reduce stigma
8. **Expected Outcome**: Embarrassment will be "short-lived" and employee will regain confidence
9. **Future Value**: Once confidence is regained, employee becomes an "excellent candidate for another promotion"

### Prohibited Action

Do NOT force the employee to leave the company. Reject the rationalization that "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake."
