# The Peter Principle

## When to Use
- Making promotion decisions for employees
- Designing or evaluating promotion systems
- Analyzing why managers may be performing poorly in their roles
- Assessing organizational competency distribution

## The Principle

### Core Concept
"In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

### Mechanism
1. Selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role
2. This selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"
3. Because promotion is based on current success, the employee continues to be promoted
4. The employee stops being promoted once they reach a role they are not skilled for
5. Result: "Managers rise to the level of their incompetence"

## Key Variables
- `current_role_performance`: The candidate's demonstrated success in their existing position
- `intended_role_abilities`: The specific skills required for the new position

## Mitigation Strategies

### Avoid the Trap
- Base promotion decisions on competencies specific to the intended role
- Assess skills required for the new role, not just success in the current role
- Recognize that skills required for different roles may be completely different

### Design Better Systems
- Create competency frameworks for each role level
- Use assessment centers or simulations to test for new role capabilities
- Provide training and development before promotion, not after
- Consider lateral moves that build diverse skills before upward promotion

## Constraints
- Does not apply if selection is based on competencies specific to the intended role
- Does not apply if skills required for the new role are identical to the current role
