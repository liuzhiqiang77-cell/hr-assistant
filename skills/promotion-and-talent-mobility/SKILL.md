# Promotion and Talent Mobility

Evaluate promotions based on performance exceeding requirements, and retain talent through "recycling" employees who were promoted beyond their current capability.

## When to Use
- Employee's performance rating is "exceeds requirements"
- Promoted employee performs below average for extended time
- Deciding whether to promote, retain, or terminate an employee
- Managing career progression within the organization

## Promotion Performance Cycle Logic

### The Promotion Cycle

**1. Initial State (Job 1)**
- Employee starts at an "average" level: **"Meets Requirements"**

**2. Improvement Phase**
- Through training and motivation, performance improves
- Employee reaches: **"Exceeds Requirements"** (above average)

**3. Promotion Trigger**
- Once employee "exceeds requirements," they become **"promotable"**
- Employee is promoted to Job 2

**4. Performance Reset**
- Upon entering Job 2, performance returns to **"Meets Requirements"** due to new challenges

**5. Cycle Repetition**
- With experience in Job 2, employee again improves to "Exceeds Requirements"
- Leads to another promotion to Job 3

**6. Cycle Conclusion**
- Cycle repeats until employee settles at "meets requirements" and is no longer promoted
- This is their "level of competence"

### Critical Constraint: The Atrophy Risk

If an employee "exceeds requirements" but is **NOT promoted**:
- Employee will **atrophy** (decline)
- Performance will **permanently return** to "meets requirements"

**Lesson**: High performers need new challenges to maintain excellence

### Promotion Decision Matrix

| Current Performance | Promotion Ready? | Action |
|---------------------|------------------|--------|
| Below Requirements | No | Address performance issues |
| Meets Requirements | No | Maintain current level |
| Exceeds Requirements | Yes | Promote to next level |
| Exceeds + No Promotion Available | Risk | Atrophy likely—find growth opportunities |

## Employee Recycling Procedure

### When to Use
- Employee has been promoted into a position "over their head"
- Employee performs below average for an extended time
- Previous role demonstrated success

### The Recycling Concept

**Definition**: Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion.

**Alternative Rejected**: Terminating the employee. Do not accept the rationalization: "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake."

### Execution Steps

**1. Identification**
- Recognize the employee is over their head
- Confirm extended below-average performance in new role

**2. Solution Selection**
- Choose to **recycle** rather than terminate

**3. Management Accountability**
- Management must admit: "We were at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness"
- Accept responsibility for the promotion decision

**4. Implementation**
- Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place person in previous successful role

**5. Support System**
- Support employee through likely embarrassment
- Execute recycling **openly** to reduce stigma

**6. Expected Outcome**
- Embarrassment will be **short-lived**
- Employee will **regain confidence**
- Once confident, employee becomes an **excellent candidate for another promotion** at a later time
- Future promotion attempts are **likely to succeed**

### Overcoming Barriers

| Barrier | Reality | Response |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Societal stigma of demotion | Stigma is short-lived | Execute openly, emphasize retention of talent |
| Seen as management failure | It IS management failure | Admit it, learn from it, fix it |
| Employee humiliation | Embarrassment passes | Provide support, focus on future success |
