# Handling Performance Extremes

This skill provides specialized approaches for managing the two performance extremes: employees with major performance problems requiring immediate turnaround, and high achievers who represent the organization's top talent.

## When to Use
- A subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing
- A subordinate is at risk of termination unless performance improves
- Conducting reviews for high achievers who need continued development
- Maximizing the leverage of top performers who account for disproportionate output

## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process

Use this process when a subordinate has a major performance problem and needs to turn around or face termination.

### Step 1: Identify the Current Stage
Track the subordinate's current stage in the resistance cycle:

| Stage | Behavior | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Ignore | Passive ignoring of the problem |
| 2 | Deny | Active denial of the problem's existence |
| 3 | Blame Others | Admits problem exists but blames others to avoid responsibility |
| 4 | Assume Responsibility | Admits "It is my problem" |
| 5 | Find Solution | Intellectual step to remedy the situation |

### Step 2: Facilitate Progression Through Stages

**From Ignore to Deny:**
- Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
- Present objective evidence of the performance problem

**From Deny to Blame Others:**
- Use evidence to overcome resistance
- Acknowledge the problem exists, even if cause is disputed

**From Blame Others to Assume Responsibility (Critical Step):**
- This is an **emotional step**, not intellectual
- Guide the subordinate to realize: "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
- This implies work and unpleasantness—the hardest part of the process

**From Assume Responsibility to Find Solution:**
- This is an **intellectual step**—relatively easier once responsibility is assumed
- Finding the solution becomes a shared task

### Step 3: Evaluate Possible Outcomes

**Outcome 1:** Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
- **Action:** Proceed with implementation plan

**Outcome 2:** Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
- **Action:** Proceed with implementation plan; agreement on diagnosis is not required

**Outcome 3:** Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit
- **Action:** Execute Fallback Procedure

### Step 4: Execute Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')

When the subordinate refuses to assume responsibility:

1. **Assume formal role:** State clearly that you are the supervisor endowed with position power
2. **State instruction:** "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. **Acknowledge disagreement:** "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. **Assert organizational requirement:** "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. **Secure commitment:** Obtain the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. **Monitor performance:** Track performance against that commitment

### Key Insight
"Assuming Responsibility" is an emotional step (hard), while "Finding Solution" is an intellectual step (easier). The breakthrough happens when the subordinate emotionally accepts ownership.

## High Achiever Development Strategy

Use this strategy when reviewing high performers to maximize their continued contribution.

### Step 1: Analyze Current Review Content
Identify if the review is:
- Purely a "retrospective assessment" (analyzing what the subordinate did in the prior year)
- Focused on justifying a high rating
- Lacking future-oriented development guidance

### Step 2: Recognize the Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying the judgment of superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better.

### Step 3: Contrast with Poor Performers
Note that poor performers often receive detailed "corrective action programs" (step-by-step affairs to meet minimum requirements), whereas high achievers often lack future-oriented guidance.

### Step 4: Shift the Priority
Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to:
- Improve performance beyond current level
- Maintain current excellence level
- Develop new capabilities for future roles

### Step 5: Apply Leverage Principle
Remember that high achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a "high-leverage activity" where the impact on group output is very great.

## Constraints
- The 'Blast' process cannot proceed to solution-finding if subordinate is stuck in denial or blame stages
- High achiever strategy does not apply to poor performers who require corrective action programs
- Manager must possess facts and examples before initiating 'Blast' process
