# 'Blast' Process Conversation Scripts

## Script 1: Moving from Ignore to Deny

**Manager:** "I've reviewed your performance over the last six months, and I need to discuss some concerning patterns."

**Subordinate:** "I think things are going fine."

**Manager:** "Let me show you the data. You missed three deadlines in Q2, your customer satisfaction scores dropped from 4.5 to 3.2, and your team has filed three formal complaints about communication. These are documented facts."

**Subordinate:** "Well, those deadlines were unrealistic..."

**Manager:** "I understand you have concerns about the deadlines, and we can discuss that. But first, I need you to acknowledge that the missed deadlines and the other issues I've documented are real. Can we agree that these performance gaps exist?"

## Script 2: Moving from Deny to Blame Others

**Manager:** "So we agree that the performance gaps exist. Now let's talk about why."

**Subordinate:** "It's not my fault. Marketing didn't give me the materials I needed. IT's systems were down half the time. My team is inexperienced."

**Manager:** "I hear that you faced challenges. Let me show you something. Here are three other managers in similar situations who faced the same Marketing delays and IT outages. Their teams delivered on time and their satisfaction scores remained high. What did they do differently?"

**Subordinate:** "I guess they had more resources..."

**Manager:** "Actually, they had fewer resources. But they adapted. They found workarounds. They communicated proactively. The question isn't whether you faced challenges—you did. The question is what you did about them."

## Script 3: Moving from Blame Others to Assume Responsibility (The Critical Step)

**Manager:** "We can spend all day listing external factors. But here's the reality: you're the only one who can control your response to those factors. If this situation continues exactly as it is for another six months—same Marketing delays, same IT issues—what will your performance look like?"

**Subordinate:** "Probably the same. Maybe worse."

**Manager:** "And what happens to your career if that continues?"

**Subordinate:** "I probably won't have one here."

**Manager:** "That's right. So here's the question I need you to answer honestly: Is this a problem you're willing to own, or is it something that's just going to keep happening to you?"

**Subordinate:** "...I guess I need to own it."

**Manager:** "What does owning it look like?"

**Subordinate:** "It means I stop making excuses and figure out how to deliver despite the challenges."

**Manager:** "Exactly. And that's going to be hard work. It's going to be uncomfortable. Are you ready for that?"

**Subordinate:** "I don't have a choice, do I?"

**Manager:** "You always have a choice. But if you want to turn this around, yes, you have work ahead of you. Let's talk about what that work looks like."

## Script 4: Fallback Procedure (Position Power)

**Manager:** "We've discussed the performance issues extensively. You've made it clear that you don't agree with my assessment that these are within your control to address."

**Subordinate:** "That's right. The situation is unfair."

**Manager:** "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right. But I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions."

**Subordinate:** "So what are you saying?"

**Manager:** "I'm saying that as your supervisor, I am instructing you to do the following: [specific actions]. I need you to commit to these actions."

**Subordinate:** "But I don't think they'll work!"

**Manager:** "You may be right. But this is what I'm requiring you to do. Can you commit to following these instructions?"

**Subordinate:** "...Yes."

**Manager:** "Thank you. I'm going to monitor your performance against these commitments. Let's meet weekly to review progress."
