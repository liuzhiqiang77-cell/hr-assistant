# Employee Performance Diagnosis: Detailed Guide

## The Diagnostic Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Performance Gap

**Observable Indicators**:
- Missed deadlines or quality standards
- Errors or mistakes in work
- Lack of initiative or engagement
- Conflict with team members
- Failure to meet objectives

**Data Collection**:
- Specific examples of performance issues
- Metrics showing gap vs. expectations
- Feedback from peers and customers
- Comparison to role requirements

### Step 2: Assess Capability (Can't Do)

**Capability Indicators**:
- Employee tries but fails despite effort
- Lack of necessary skills or knowledge
- Inability to apply training to work
- Confusion about expectations or processes
- Technical gaps in required tools or methods

**Assessment Questions**:
- Does the employee know what success looks like?
- Have they been trained on the required skills?
- Do they have access to necessary resources?
- Is the task within their current ability level?
- Have they demonstrated this capability before?

**Training Solutions**:
- Formal training programs
- On-the-job coaching and mentoring
- Job shadowing experienced performers
- Documentation and SOPs
- Practice and feedback loops

### Step 3: Assess Motivation (Won't Do)

**Motivation Indicators**:
- Employee has capability but doesn't apply it
- Resistance to feedback or coaching
- Lack of effort or engagement
- Negative attitude or complaints
- Selective performance (good at preferred tasks, poor at others)

**Assessment Questions**:
- Does the employee understand why the work matters?
- Are there consequences for poor performance?
- Is the work aligned with employee's interests?
- Are there personal issues affecting motivation?
- Does the employee see a path for growth?

**Motivation Solutions**:
- Clarify impact and importance of work
- Set clear expectations and accountability
- Provide recognition and rewards
- Address personal or work environment issues
- Connect work to employee's goals and values

### Step 4: Apply the Right Intervention

| Diagnosis | Intervention | Timeline | Success Metrics |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Can't Do | Training | Weeks to months | Skill acquisition, performance improvement |
| Won't Do | Motivation | Days to weeks | Engagement increase, effort improvement |

### Step 5: Monitor and Adjust

**For Training Interventions**:
- Assess skill acquisition after training
- Observe application to actual work
- Provide coaching during transition
- Measure performance improvement

**For Motivation Interventions**:
- Monitor engagement and effort levels
- Check for sustained improvement
- Gather feedback on what's working
- Adjust incentives or consequences as needed

## Common Pitfalls

### Misdiagnosis

**Treating "Won't" as "Can't"**:
- Sending unmotivated employee to training
- Wastes resources, doesn't address root cause
- Employee may become resentful

**Treating "Can't" as "Won't"**:
- Disciplining employee who lacks capability
- Damages morale and trust
- Performance doesn't improve

### Mixed Cases

Sometimes both factors exist:
- Employee lacks some skills AND is unmotivated
- Address capability first (can't perform what you're not motivated to do)
- Then address motivation

### The "Nothing Else" Constraint

Grove's principle: "There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train."

**What this means**:
- Don't waste time on things that don't address capability or motivation
- Avoid "trying harder" conversations without specific action
- Focus interventions on the two root causes
- If neither training nor motivation works, the role may be wrong fit

## Advanced Applications

### For Teams
- Diagnose team-level capability vs. motivation
- Address systemic training needs
- Build team motivation and culture

### For Organizations
- Identify capability gaps across workforce
- Address motivation killers in systems and processes
- Build learning and development infrastructure

### For Self-Diagnosis
- Am I not performing because I can't or won't?
- What training do I need?
- What motivates me?
- How can I communicate this to my manager?
