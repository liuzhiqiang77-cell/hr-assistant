# Interview Questioning Techniques

Apply these questioning and assessment techniques when conducting an interview session to evaluate a candidate comprehensively within limited time constraints.

## Ask Specific Recommended Questions

Assess the candidate using these targeted inquiries:

- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

## Categorize Inquiries for Coverage

Ensure you cover all assessment areas:

- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, weaknesses, technical capabilities
- **Application of Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures, how knowledge was applied
- **Discrepancies**: Learning from failures, problems in current position, prevention strategies
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new job, why the company should hire them

## Utilize Direct Questions

- Ask blunt questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?") to elicit direct answers
- Observe the candidate's reaction and the confidence/timidity of the response to gauge actual capability
- The response quality often indicates true competence

## Employ Hypothetical Situations

- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps, software development workflow)
- Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result (e.g., finished cost of a product)
- Assess their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly

## Invite Candidate Questions

- Ask the candidate what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job
- Analyze their questions to determine:
  - What they already know about the role/industry
  - What they value (benefits, growth, culture, etc.)
  - How prepared they are for the interview

## Considerations

- Recognize that candidate may provide self-assessment that is not entirely accurate
- Work within limited time constraints (typically one to two hours)
- Combine multiple techniques to get a well-rounded view of the candidate
