# Performance Monitoring Techniques

Use this skill when you need to:
- Conduct daily operational reviews and take corrective action
- Track progress toward deadlines with early warning signals
- Forecast future business trends and evaluate forecast accuracy
- Monitor monthly goals or recruitment campaigns

## Daily Operational Review Checklist

Perform this checklist when starting daily operations or arriving at the office:

### 1. Review Sales Forecast
Determine the number of units planned for delivery today

### 2. Analyze Variance
Compare yesterday's actual deliveries against yesterday's planned deliveries to assess confidence in today's forecast

### 3. Check Raw Material Inventory
Verify stock levels of essential items
- **IF too low**: Order more supplies immediately
- **IF too high**: Cancel scheduled deliveries

### 4. Assess Equipment Condition
Check if any equipment broke down yesterday
- **IF breakdown**: Arrange repairs or rearrange production line

### 5. Evaluate Manpower
Check staff availability
- **IF understaffed**: Call temporary help OR reallocate from other lines

### 6. Monitor Quality Indicator
Review customer complaint log
- **IF high complaints**: Speak to responsible staff immediately

## Apply Linearity Indicator

### Plot Progress Against Time
- X-axis: Time elapsed (months, weeks, days)
- Y-axis: Actual output achieved

### Define Ideal Straight Line
Linear trajectory from starting point (zero or baseline) to final target at deadline

### Compare and Interpret

**Scenario A: Below Line**
- Example: In April, recruiting is 40% complete but should be 50%
- **Action**: Calculate required rate for remaining period and accelerate immediately

**Scenario B: Back-Loaded**
- Example: Manufacturing output concentrated in last week of month
- **Action**: Address resource allocation - indicates inefficient manpower/equipment usage

### Purpose
Provides 'early warning' to allow time for corrective action before deadline passes

## Use Stagger Chart Forecasting

### Create the Matrix
- **Rows**: Month the forecast was made
- **Columns**: Future months being forecasted

### Update Monthly
1. In first month (e.g., July), fill forecasts for Aug, Sep, Oct, etc.
2. In second month (e.g., August), create new row with updated forecasts
3. Repeat every month, adding new row

### Analyze Variations
- Compare forecasts for same target month made in different prior months
- **Example**: Compare August's forecast for December vs September's forecast for December
- Look for improvement or deterioration in outlook

### Benefits
- Forces forecaster to take task seriously (past forecasts will be compared)
- Provides more valuable indicator of business trends than simple trend chart
- Shows evolution of expectations over time
