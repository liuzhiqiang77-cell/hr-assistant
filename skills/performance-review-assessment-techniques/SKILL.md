# Performance Review Assessment Techniques

## When to Use
- Reviewing performance where tangible outputs lag behind activities
- Evaluating managers whose organizations performed poorly
- Conducting reviews for high achievers/top performers
- Assessing work with long-term impact

## Time Offset and Long-Term Assessment

### The "Light from Distant Stars" Principle
Current output may reflect work done months or years ago. Recognize the lag between activity and result.

### Step 1: Analyze Time Offset
- Determine if output in the review period is linked to activities in the same period
- Identify work where results will materialize in future periods

### Step 2: Judge Performance Based on Activities
If tangible output is absent but activities were strong:
- Give credit for performance
- Do not penalize for lack of immediate output if building future capacity

**Example**: Setting up a facility from scratch requires significant activity before any output appears.

### Step 3: Weigh Long-term vs Short-term
| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Immediate outputs | Meeting schedules, hitting current targets |
| Future-oriented activities | Improving design methods, building infrastructure |

### Step 4: Apply "Present Value" Concept
- Estimate how much the future-oriented activity will pay back over time
- Determine what that future value is worth today
- Use this to decide current significance and rating

## The Potential Trap Rule

### Core Principle
**The performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the rating accorded to his organization.**

### Step 1: Assess Substance over Form
| Substance (Real Performance) | Form (Potential - Ignore) |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Actual output | Knowledge |
| Real results | Handling oneself well |
| Measurable impact | Looking like a manager |

### Step 2: Apply the Organization Cap
Compare manager rating to organization rating:
- If organization performed poorly → Manager cannot receive high rating
- If business unit lost money, missed forecasts, slipped schedules → Manager rating is capped

### Step 3: Enforce Consequences
**Reject excuses** such as:
- "The organization failed but I'm outstanding"
- External factors beyond my control

### Step 4: Prevent Negative Signaling
Avoid signaling that "acting" like a manager is sufficient. Reinforce that **performing** like a manager is the requirement.

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### The Problem
Supervisors often:
- Spend effort justifying the judgment of superior performance
- Give little attention to how the subordinate could do even better
- Provide detailed corrective action programs for poor performers but not for high achievers

### The Opportunity
High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a **high-leverage activity**.

### Step 1: Analyze Current Review Content
Determine if the review is:
- Purely retrospective (analyzing past performance)
- Focused on justifying a high rating
- Lacking future-oriented guidance

### Step 2: Contrast with Poor Performers
| Poor Performers | High Achievers |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Detailed corrective action programs | Often lack future guidance |
| Step-by-step improvement plans | Generic praise only |
| Clear minimum requirements | No specific improvement steps |

### Step 3: Shift Priority
Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to:
- Improve performance further
- Maintain current excellence
- Develop new capabilities

### Step 4: Leverage the Impact
Remember: Small improvements in high achievers yield large organizational gains due to their disproportionate output contribution.
