# Performance Management - Detailed Reference

## Competitive Sports Approach - Examples

### Facility Maintenance Competition
- Assign "building czar" to score each building
- Compare scores across buildings
- Result: Immediate improvement without monetary rewards
- Key: Visible metrics create self-sustaining competition

### Sales Team Competition
- Track individual sales performance publicly
- Create monthly "leaderboard"
- Coach provides feedback on techniques, not just results
- Normalize that top performers will have off months

## Black Box Assessment - Weighting Scenarios

### Startup Phase (90/10 Output/Internal)
- Focus: Survival through immediate results
- Internal measures: Critical but secondary
- Example: Sales team hitting quotas

### Growth Phase (50/50 Output/Internal)
- Focus: Scaling while building capability
- Internal measures: Team development, process improvement
- Example: Engineering manager delivering features while growing team

### Stabilization Phase (10/90 Output/Internal)
- Focus: Long-term organizational health
- Internal measures: Succession planning, culture building
- Example: Senior executive preparing organization for next phase

## Constraints and Considerations

### Competitive Approach
- Requires culture that accepts feedback
- May not work if competition leads to destructive behavior
- Must ensure metrics are fair and comparable
- Risk: Competition can undermine collaboration if not managed

### Black Box Assessment
- Difficult to apply strictly objectively to professional work
- Internal measures can be subjective
- Requires manager judgment and transparency
- Risk: Weighting can appear arbitrary if not explained

## Fear Management

### Positive Fear of Failure
- Spurs preparation and effort
- Drives focus on improvement
- Creates urgency and engagement

### Negative Fear of Failure
- Causes conservative risk-avoidance
- Leads to hiding problems
- Results in innovation stagnation

### Management Balance
- Set challenging but achievable goals
- Celebrate effort and learning from failure
- Distinguish between "good failure" (trying and missing) and "bad failure" (not trying or not preparing)
