# Delegation Examples and Scenarios

## Task Selection Examples

### Good Delegation Choices (Familiar Tasks)
- Writing a report you've written many times before
- Managing a project type you've overseen previously
- Conducting analysis using methods you know well
- Customer interactions in a domain you understand

### Poor Delegation Choices (Unfamiliar Tasks)
- First-time implementation of new technology
- Novel project type with no precedent
- Analysis using unfamiliar methodology
- Negotiations in a new market/region

## Monitoring by TRM Level

### Low TRM (New to Task)
**Frequency**: Daily or every other day
**Monitoring Points**:
- Check initial approach before work begins
- Review progress at 25% completion
- Spot-check intermediate deliverables
- Review final output before submission

### Medium TRM (Some Experience)
**Frequency**: Weekly
**Monitoring Points**:
- Review rough drafts or early versions
- Check key milestones
- Sample specific details randomly
- Discuss approach and challenges

### High TRM (Experienced)
**Frequency**: Bi-weekly or monthly
**Monitoring Points**:
- Review final outputs
- Check in on major milestones only
- Sample occasionally to maintain standards
- Focus on strategic alignment, not tactics

## Lowest-Added-Value Stage Examples

| Task Type | Lowest-Added-Value Stage | When to Monitor |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Report writing | Rough draft outline | Before full writing begins |
| Software development | Architecture/design | Before coding starts |
| Sales presentation | Slide outline | Before building slides |
| Process improvement | Problem analysis | Before solution design |
| Event planning | Venue and budget | Before detailed planning |

## Common Delegation Mistakes

### The "Pencil Experiment"
A manager delegates a task but keeps the "pencil"—making all the decisions and corrections while pretending the subordinate owns the work.

**Signs**:
- Manager constantly interrupts with corrections
- Subordinate waits for approval on every detail
- Manager rewrites work rather than providing feedback
- Subordinate shows no ownership of outcomes

**Solution**:
- Delegate the outcome, not just the activity
- Provide clear criteria for success
- Let the subordinate make mistakes within safe bounds
- Review at appropriate intervals, not continuously

### Abdication vs. Delegation

| Abdication | Delegation |
|------------|------------|
| "Here, you handle it" | "Here's what success looks like" |
| No follow-up | Regular monitoring |
| No support | Available for guidance |
| Blames subordinate if fails | Takes responsibility for outcome |
| Washes hands of task | Retains accountability |
