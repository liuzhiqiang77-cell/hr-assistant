# Delegation Anti-Patterns

## Customer Tuition

**Definition**: Allowing subordinates to learn by making mistakes that are paid for by customers (internal or external).

**Why it's harmful**:
- Damages customer relationships
- Costs the company money and reputation
- Erodes trust in the team
- Creates rework and cleanup effort

**Correct approach**: Teach correct operational values early. Supervisor assumes responsibility for training before the subordinate interacts with customers.

## Abdication Disguised as Delegation

**Definition": Assigning a task and washing your hands of it, with no follow-up or monitoring.

**Why it's harmful**:
- Subordinate lacks support and guidance
- Problems are discovered too late
- Quality suffers
- Supervisor fails in accountability

**Correct approach**: "Delegation without follow-through is abdication." Remain responsible for the outcome, monitor appropriately, and provide support as needed.

## The Pencil Experiment

**Definition**: Emotionally holding onto a task while pretending to delegate it.

**Example**: Telling a subordinate to handle a presentation but then rewriting it yourself because "it's faster."

**Why it's harmful**:
- Confuses the subordinate about ownership
- Undermines trust and confidence
- Prevents subordinate learning
- Wastes time on pretense

**Correct approach**: Either delegate genuinely (with appropriate monitoring) or keep the task consciously. Don't pretend.

## One-Size-Fits-All Monitoring

**Definition**: Applying the same monitoring intensity to all subordinates regardless of TRM.

**Why it's harmful**:
- Over-monitors high-TRM subordinates (demotivating)
- Under-monitors low-TRM subordinates (risky)
- Wastes manager time on inappropriate activities

**Correct approach**: Adjust monitoring frequency and intensity based on task-relevant maturity.

## Delegating Unfamiliar Tasks

**Definition**: Choosing to delegate tasks you don't understand well.

**Why it's harmful**:
- Difficult to assess quality
- Hard to provide meaningful guidance
- May miss critical issues

**Correct approach**: When given a choice, delegate familiar tasks. If you must delegate unfamiliar tasks, invest time in understanding them first or pair with a more experienced reviewer.
