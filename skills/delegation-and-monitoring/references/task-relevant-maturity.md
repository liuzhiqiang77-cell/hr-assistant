# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

TRM is a foundational concept for delegation and supervision.

## Definition
Task-Relevant Maturity is a combination of:
- Degree of achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience

## Key Characteristics
- **Task-specific**: TRM is specific to the task at hand. A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another.
- **Dynamic**: TRM can change day by day or hour by hour.
- **Context-dependent**: Even seasoned managers may have low TRM if the environment, content, and tasks are new.

## Factors Causing Low TRM
- New environment, content, or tasks
- Accelerated pace of the job
- Abrupt changes in the job itself

## Distinguishing from General Competence
Do not confuse a manager's general competence and maturity with their task-relevant maturity. High general maturity does not guarantee high TRM in a new role.
