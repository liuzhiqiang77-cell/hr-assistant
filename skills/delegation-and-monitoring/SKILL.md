# Delegation and Monitoring

## When to Use

- Delegating tasks to free up time or assign work
- Monitoring progress on delegated tasks
- Establishing the foundation for management style progression from close to loose supervision
- Preventing subordinates from learning through customer-impacting mistakes

## Establish Delegation Prerequisites

**Shared Operational Values**
- Commonality of values, priorities, and preferences is required
- Supervisor is accountable for transmitting common values
- Supervisor must teach correct operational values early to prevent "customer tuition"
- Without shared values, effective delegation is impossible

**Common Information Base**
- Delegator and delegatee must share understanding and context
- Without common information, delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage

## Execute Delegation

**Task Selection**
- Delegate activities familiar to you rather than unfamiliar ones
- Easier to monitor tasks you know best
- Avoid insincere delegation (holding onto tasks emotionally while pretending to delegate)
- If keeping a task because you enjoy it, make it a conscious decision

**Responsibility Principle**
- "Delegation without follow-through is abdication"
- Never wash your hands of a task
- Remain responsible for the outcome even after delegating

## Monitor Delegated Tasks

**Monitoring Purpose**
- Ensures activity proceeds in line with expectations
- Only practical way to ensure a result
- Should not become meddling (prescribing specific activities)

**Quality Assurance Principle 1: Timing**
- Monitor at the lowest-added-value stage of the process
- Example: Review rough drafts rather than waiting for final polished versions
- Catch basic content problems early before expensive polishing

**Quality Assurance Principle 2: Sampling**
- Do not check 100% of details
- Go into details randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress
- Similar to statistical quality control sampling

**Adjust Frequency by Task-Relevant Maturity**
- **Low TRM (new to task)**: Increase monitoring frequency
- **Growing TRM**: Decrease intensity as work improves
- **High TRM**: Minimal monitoring required
- TRM = subordinate's specific experience and prior performance with the task

## Management Style Progression

**Internalize Structure**
- As TRM grows, structure moves from externally imposed to internally adopted
- Manager's role shifts from close supervision to loose supervision
- Shared operational values enable this progression

**Prevent Customer Tuition**
- Do not allow subordinates to learn by making mistakes that customers pay for
- Supervisor must assume responsibility for teaching correct values early
- Supervisor accountability for subordinate output requires this investment
