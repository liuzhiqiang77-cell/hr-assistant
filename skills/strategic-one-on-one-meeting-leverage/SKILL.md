# Strategic One-on-One Meeting Leverage

## When to Use
- A supervisor schedules a recurring one-on-one meeting with a subordinate (e.g., every two weeks)
- A hierarchical reporting relationship exists
- You need to upgrade the supervisor's understanding of the subordinate's tasks
- You need to enable efficient and effective delegation

## Execution Steps

### 1. Calculate Leverage Potential
Recognize that a small time investment (e.g., 1.5 hours) can enhance the quality of a subordinate's work for a significant duration (e.g., two weeks or 80+ hours).

### 2. Establish Common Base
Use the meeting to develop a "common base of information" and "similar ways of doing and handling things" between supervisor and subordinate. This shared base is essential for efficient delegation.

### 3. Facilitate Reverse Teaching
Allow the subordinate to teach the supervisor specific details and data that the supervisor may only be vaguely familiar with. This information is essential for making good decisions.

### 4. Joint Data Analysis
Review specific indicators (e.g., trend indicators of incoming orders) together. Ponder the data and consider their relationship to other industry indicators to distinguish between:
- Temporary anomalies (e.g., seasonal slowness)
- Actual business trends (e.g., business stopped growing)

### 5. Formulate Congruent Conclusions
Develop a "congruent attitude, approach, and conclusion" based on the shared analysis.

Example: Deciding to take a "conservative approach to near-term investment" rather than assuming growth.

### 6. Execute Cascading Actions
- **Subordinate**: Implements decisions in their specific area of responsibility (e.g., scale back growth)
- **Supervisor**: Shares the conclusions with other business groups or managers they supervise, multiplying the leverage across the organization

## Constraints
- Requires willingness to share information openly
- Requires time investment from supervisor
