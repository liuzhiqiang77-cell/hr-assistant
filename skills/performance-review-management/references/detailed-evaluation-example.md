# Materials Support Supervisor Performance Evaluation Example

This detailed evaluation framework illustrates application of performance review principles to a specific management role transition (finance to manufacturing).

## Core Responsibilities

- Managing the production planning process
- Managing the manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

## Evaluation Criteria

### Production Planning Performance

- Check for significant process changes during the review period
- Verify site coordination and administrative activity efficiency
- **Rating**: "good" if sites are well coordinated and activities are efficiently done

### Manufacturing Specifications Performance

#### Goal Setting Assessment

**Negative Indicators**:
- Difficulty setting objectives and key results
- "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews (e.g., March review)
- Lack of definitive statement on system direction

**Consequence**: Falling into the trap of "working on" things without reaching objectives.

#### Meeting Effectiveness Assessment

**Negative Indicator**: Satisfaction that having a meeting on a subject constitutes progress.

**Corrective Action**: Employee must define specific results to accomplish *prior* to each meeting.

### Strengths & Background Utilization

- Evaluate speed of learning (getting up to speed quickly to take over from predecessor)
- Evaluate utilization of prior background (e.g., finance) to assist other areas voluntarily

## Promotion Eligibility

**Current Status**: Promotion to next management level is denied if specific criteria are not met.

**Required Capabilities**:
- Ability to take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system) and show results
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of the way to achieve those goals

**Independence Requirement**: Employee must be the "primary driver"; supervisor helps only when needed. Promotion is contingent on demonstrating capability for independent work.

## Final Rating Determination

**Meets Requirements**: Assigned if capable of doing current job, but acknowledging specific areas (goal setting, defining ways of accomplishing tasks) need improvement.

**Context Adjustment**: Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance.
