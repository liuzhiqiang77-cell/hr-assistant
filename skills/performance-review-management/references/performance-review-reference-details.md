## Delivery Techniques

### Nonverbal Communication Cues

**Engaged Listening Indicators**:
- Eye contact
- Nodding
- Leaning forward
- Taking notes
- Appropriate facial expressions

**Disengagement Indicators**:
- Looking away
- Blank expression
- Checking phone/watch
- Crossing arms defensively
- No questions or comments

### Handling Emotional Reactions

**Defensive Behavior**:
- Acknowledge: "I understand this is difficult to hear"
- Reiterate: "My goal is to help you improve"
- Refocus: "Let's talk about how we can address this"

**Emotional Shutdown**:
- Pause: "Let's take a moment"
- Check in: "How are you feeling about this?"
- Resume when ready

**Anger**:
- Stay calm
- Don't argue
- Acknowledge feelings: "I can see you're upset"
- Move to solutions: "What can we do differently?"

### Verification Questions
Use these to ensure understanding:
- "What are your thoughts on what I've shared?"
- "How does this align with your own assessment?"
- "What questions do you have?"
- "Can you summarize the key takeaways?"

## Common Pitfalls

### Preparation Pitfalls
- **Editing while brainstorming**: Write everything first, filter later
- **Focusing only on recent events**: Review entire period
- **Ignoring patterns**: Look for themes, not isolated incidents
- **Too many messages**: 3-5 is typically the maximum

### Delivery Pitfalls
- **Sandwiching praise and criticism**: Be direct, not manipulative
- **Using vague language**: Be specific with examples
- **Avoiding difficult topics**: Deliver all necessary messages
- **Making it about you**: Keep focus on subordinate's performance
- **Rushing**: Allow time for processing and questions
