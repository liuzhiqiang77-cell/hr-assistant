## Verification Techniques in Action

### Scenario: Delivering Difficult Feedback

**Supervisor:** "Your code review quality has declined over the past quarter."

**Subordinate Response Analysis:**
- **Looking down, arms crossed:** Defensive, not receiving message
- **Nodding slowly, taking notes:** Receiving, processing
- **Immediate defensive explanation:** Not listening, formulating response
- **Silence, then 'I understand':** Likely receiving message

**Appropriate Actions:**
- If defensive: Pause, ask "What are your thoughts on this?"
- If nodding: Continue, then verify understanding
- If explaining: Stop them gently, "Let me finish the point first, then I want to hear your perspective"
