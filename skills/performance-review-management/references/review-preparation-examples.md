## Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Delivering Difficult Feedback

**Situation:**
- Message: Performance below expectations
- Subordinate likely to be defensive

**Application of Three L's:**

**Level:**
- "I need to be direct: your performance this quarter has not met expectations."
- Don't soften with "maybe" or "sort of"

**Listen:**
- Watch for defensive body language (crossed arms, looking away)
- If subordinate interrupts, acknowledge and redirect
- Check for understanding: "Can you tell me what you heard me say?"

**Leave Yourself Out:**
- Don't say "I feel bad telling you this"
- Don't make it about your difficulty delivering the message
- Focus entirely on their performance and what needs to change

### Scenario 2: Delivering Positive Feedback

**Situation:**
- Message: Outstanding performance on project
- Subordinate may be uncomfortable with praise

**Application of Three L's:**

**Level:**
- "Your work on the XYZ project was exceptional. You exceeded all expectations."
- Be specific and direct

**Listen:**
- Watch for discomfort (looking down, deflecting)
- Ensure they accept the praise
- Check: "Do you understand why this was exceptional?"

**Leave Yourself Out:**
- Don't say "I'm so proud of you" (makes it about you)
- Don't say "I knew you could do it" (takes credit)
- Focus entirely on their achievement

### Scenario 3: Mixed Review

**Situation:**
- Messages: 2 positive, 1 negative
- Subordinate may focus only on negative

**Application of Three L's:**

**Level:**
- Present all messages clearly
- Don't bury negative in excessive positive
- Don't minimize positive to "soften" negative

**Listen:**
- Watch for emotional shutdown after negative message
- Ensure they hear all messages
- Check understanding of each point

**Leave Yourself Out:**
- Don't express relief when done
- Don't apologize for negative feedback
- Stay focused on their performance

## Common Preparation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Editing During Brainstorming
- **Problem**: Self-censoring while writing worksheet
- **Consequence**: Important issues missed
- **Solution**: Write everything first, filter later

### Mistake 2: Too Many Messages
- **Problem**: 8-10 messages identified
- **Consequence**: Subordinate can't remember or act on all
- **Solution**: Filter to 3-5 maximum

### Mistake 3: No Evidence
- **Problem**: Messages without specific examples
- **Consequence**: Subordinate disputes or doesn't understand
- **Solution**: Always gather concrete evidence

### Mistake 4: Avoiding Surprises
- **Problem**: Withholding startling feedback
- **Consequence**: Performance doesn't improve
- **Solution**: Deliver it, even if uncomfortable

## Common Delivery Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Leveling
- **Problem**: Softening the message to avoid discomfort
- **Consequence**: Subordinate doesn't understand severity
- **Solution**: Be direct and frank

### Mistake 2: Not Listening
- **Problem**: Focusing on what you say, not what they hear
- **Consequence**: Message not received or understood
- **Solution**: Verify understanding throughout

### Mistake 3: Making It About You
- **Problem**: Expressing your emotions about delivering feedback
- **Consequence**: Focus shifts from their performance to your feelings
- **Solution**: Leave yourself out completely
