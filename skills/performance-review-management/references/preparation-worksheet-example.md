# Preparation Worksheet Example

## Step 1: Brainstorming (Unfiltered List)

Write everything down—major, minor, and trivial:

- Project A completed 2 weeks early
- Missed deadline on Project B
- Great presentation at client meeting
- Arrived late to team meetings 3 times
- Helped new team member onboard
- Quality issues in monthly report
- Excellent customer feedback
- Did not update CRM system
- Strong technical skills
- Needs improvement in delegation

## Step 2: Relationship Analysis

Look for patterns:

**Pattern 1**: Strong execution but poor follow-through
- Project A early ✓
- Project B missed deadline ✗
- CRM not updated ✗
- Monthly report quality issues ✗

**Pattern 2**: Strong interpersonal skills
- Great client presentation ✓
- Helped new team member ✓
- Excellent customer feedback ✓

**Pattern 3**: Time management issues
- Late to meetings (3 times)
- Missed deadline

## Step 3: Message Formulation

Convert patterns to messages:

1. **Message**: You excel at client-facing work and team collaboration
2. **Message**: You struggle with administrative follow-through and time management
3. **Message**: Strong technical execution needs better planning discipline

## Step 4: Evidence Gathering

Support each message with specific examples:

**Message 1 Evidence**:
- Client presentation on [date] received positive feedback
- Onboarded [name] successfully in [month]
- Customer satisfaction score: [X]

**Message 2 Evidence**:
- CRM updates missed: [dates]
- Monthly report errors: [specific examples]
- Late arrivals: [dates]

**Message 3 Evidence**:
- Project A: early completion
- Project B: missed deadline due to poor planning

## Step 5: Filtering

Ask: Can the subordinate remember all 3 messages?

If yes → Keep all 3
If no → Prioritize and defer less critical items to next review
