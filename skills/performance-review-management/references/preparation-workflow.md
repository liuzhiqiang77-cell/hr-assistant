# Performance Review Preparation Workflow

## Input Materials
- Progress reports
- Performance against quarterly objectives
- One-on-one meeting notes

## Output
- Prioritized list of "messages"
- Specific examples supporting each message
- Ready for delivery

## Time Management Tips
- Brainstorming: Don't rush—let everything come out
- Filtering: Be ruthless—fewer messages are better remembered
- Surprises: Address them immediately, don't defer

## Common Pitfalls
- Editing during brainstorming (prevents full picture)
- Keeping too many messages (overwhelms subordinate)
- Avoiding surprising messages (misses improvement opportunity)
- Letting documentation drive the conversation (worksheet should guide)
