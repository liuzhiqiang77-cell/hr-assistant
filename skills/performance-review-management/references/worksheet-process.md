# Performance Review Worksheet Process

## Step-by-Step Worksheet Creation

### Setup
- **Materials**: Blank paper, pen, all documentation nearby
- **Environment**: Quiet, uninterrupted time
- **Mindset**: Non-judgmental, everything goes on paper

### Brainstorming Phase

**Do:**
- Write every single thing that comes to mind
- Include major achievements and minor incidents
- Include positive and negative observations
- Note patterns you've noticed
- Include things you're not sure about
- Write in any order—no organizing yet

**Don't:**
- Edit or filter as you write
- Worry about importance yet
- Organize or categorize
- Judge whether something "counts"
- Stop because something seems trivial

### Example Worksheet Entries
```
- Always late to Monday staff meetings
- Great job on the Q2 report—very thorough
- Interrupts others in meetings frequently
- Took initiative on the XYZ project
- Missed deadline on ABC deliverable
- Team members seem to like working with them
- Doesn't speak up in senior leadership meetings
- Excellent client presentation last month
- Needs to improve documentation
- Often works late but productivity unclear
- Good at mentoring junior staff
- Struggles with delegation
- ...
```

### Relationship Analysis

After brainstorming, look for connections:

**Example patterns:**
- "Always late to meetings" + "Interrupts others" + "Doesn't speak up in senior meetings" → **Message: Professional presence and meeting etiquette need improvement**
- "Great job on Q2 report" + "Excellent client presentation" + "Thorough analysis" → **Message: Strong analytical and communication skills**
- "Missed deadline" + "Struggles with delegation" + "Works late but unclear productivity" → **Message: Time management and prioritization challenges**
- "Took initiative on XYZ" + "Good at mentoring" + "Team likes working with them" → **Message: Strong leadership potential and team collaboration**

### Message Formulation

Convert patterns into clear, actionable messages:

**Good messages:**
- "Your analytical work is consistently strong and well-received by clients"
- "You need to improve your meeting presence—both punctuality and how you engage with others"
- "Your leadership with junior staff is excellent; let's build on that strength"
- "Time management is an area for development—specifically prioritization and delegation"

**Poor messages:**
- "You're sometimes late" (too vague)
- "Good job overall" (not specific)
- "You need to work on everything" (overwhelming)
- "People like you" (not actionable)

### Evidence Gathering

For each message, pull specific examples from your worksheet:

**Message:** "Your analytical work is consistently strong and well-received by clients"
**Evidence:**
- Q2 report was comprehensive and identified key trends
- Client presentation on [date] received positive feedback
- Analysis of [project] prevented a costly error

### Filtering

**Test each message:**
1. Is this message important for the subordinate's development?
2. Is this message supported by clear evidence?
3. Can the subordinate remember and act on this message?
4. Is this message distinct from other messages?

**If NO to any question:** Consider removing or combining with another message.

**Aim for 3-5 messages maximum.**

### Handling Surprises

**If you discover something that surprises you:**

1. **Verify**: Is this accurate? Check your documentation.
2. **Reflect**: Why didn't you notice this earlier?
3. **Prepare**: How will you deliver this message constructively?
4. **Deliver**: Include it in the review—it's important for improvement

**Example surprise:**
- You thought the subordinate was doing well, but worksheet reveals consistent missed deadlines
- **Action**: "Swallow hard and bring it up"—this is critical for their improvement
- **Delivery**: "Looking at the data, I see a pattern of missed deadlines that concerns me..."
