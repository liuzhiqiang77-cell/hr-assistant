# Delivery Verification Checklist

## During the Review

### Level (Frankness) Check
- [ ] Am I being totally frank?
- [ ] Am I holding back anything important?
- [ ] Am I making praise as direct as criticism?
- [ ] Is my tone clear and straightforward?
- [ ] Am I avoiding euphemisms?

### Listen (Communication) Check

**Before stating a key point:**
- [ ] Is the subordinate emotionally ready to receive it?
- [ ] Are they looking at me, not formulating a response?
- [ ] Are they tuned in, not checked out?

**After stating a key point:**
- [ ] Did I watch their face for reaction?
- [ ] Did they give verbal confirmation ("I understand", "Got it")?
- [ ] Did they give nonverbal confirmation (nodding, eye contact, note-taking)?
- [ ] Do I have evidence they actually understood?

**If understanding is not confirmed:**
- [ ] Did I explain it again?
- [ ] Did I explain it a different way?
- [ ] Did I ask them to summarize what they heard?
- [ ] Did I maintain eye contact (not look at blackboard/notes)?

### Leave Yourself Out Check

**Emotional State:**
- [ ] Am I feeling anxious about this conversation?
- [ ] Do I feel guilty about what I need to say?
- [ ] Am I worried about their reaction?
- [ ] Am I making it about my feelings, not their performance?

**Focus:**
- [ ] Am I talking about MY experience of them, or THEIR performance?
- [ ] Am I using "I" statements inappropriately ("I feel like you...")?
- [ ] Am I letting my stage fright affect delivery?
- [ ] Is this review about the subordinate, not me?

## Verification Questions to Ask the Subordinate

### After Each Key Point
- "What did you hear me say?"
- "How does that land with you?"
- "Does that make sense given what you've experienced this year?"

### At End of Review
- "What are your key takeaways from today's discussion?"
- "What questions do you have about what I've said?"
- "Is there anything I said that doesn't feel right to you?"

## Signs of Blocked Communication

| Barrier | Observable Sign | What to Do |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Too emotional | Crying, anger, defensive | Pause, acknowledge emotion, continue when ready |
| Formulating response | Looking away, rapid blinking | "Hold that thought — let me finish first" |
| Tuned out | Blank stare, fidgeting | Stop, check in, restart if needed |
| Confusion | Furrowed brow, squinting | Rephrase, ask them to restate |
| Disagreement | Crossing arms, head shaking | Ask what they disagree with, discuss |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using a tape recorder to "prove" what was said
- Looking at your notes/blackboard instead of the person
- Letting your own emotions drive the conversation
- Moving on without confirming understanding
- Making it about your discomfort rather than their performance
- Assuming silence = understanding
