# The Three L's: Detailed Techniques

## L1: Level - Being Totally Frank

### Why It's Hard
- **Fear of hurting feelings**: We don't want to cause pain
- **Fear of conflict**: We avoid difficult conversations
- **Praising difficulty**: Straightforward praise can feel awkward or insincere
- **Power dynamics**: We may feel uncomfortable exercising authority

### Techniques for Leveling

**For negative feedback:**
- State the observation clearly: "I've noticed that..."
- State the impact: "This affects the team because..."
- State the expectation: "Going forward, I need..."
- Avoid qualifiers like "kind of," "sort of," "a little bit"

**For positive feedback:**
- Be specific: "You did an excellent job on..."
- State the impact: "This resulted in..."
- Connect to strengths: "This demonstrates your ability to..."
- Avoid minimizing: "Not bad for a first try" → "Great work on your first project"

**For mixed messages:**
- State the positive first
- State the negative clearly
- State the positive again or end constructively
- Example: "Your analysis is excellent. However, your timeliness needs improvement. With better time management, your analytical skills will have even greater impact."

### What to Avoid
- Softening to the point of confusion
- Using "compliment sandwiches" that bury the message
- Hinting rather than stating directly
- Making it about you ("I feel bad saying this...")

## L2: Listen - Ensuring Understanding

### Nonverbal Signs of Understanding
- **Nodding**: Agreement or acknowledgment
- **Taking notes**: Engagement and processing
- **Eye contact**: Attention and focus
- **Leaning forward**: Interest and engagement
- **Verbal affirmations**: "I see," "Right," "Understood"

### Nonverbal Signs of Not Understanding
- **Blank expression**: Confusion or disengagement
- **Furrowed brow**: Confusion or concern
- **Looking away**: Distraction or avoidance
- **Fidgeting**: Discomfort or impatience
- **No response**: Not processing or disagreement

### Verification Techniques

**The Check-In:**
"I want to make sure I'm being clear. Can you tell me what you heard me say about [topic]?"

**The Reflection:**
"So what I'm saying is [restate message]. Is that how you understand it?"

**The Application:**
"Given this feedback, what do you think your next steps should be?"

### When They Don't Understand

**If they're confused:**
- Rephrase: "Let me say this a different way..."
- Use examples: "For instance, last week when..."
- Check again: "Does that make more sense?"

**If they're defensive:**
- Acknowledge: "I know this is difficult to hear."
- Reaffirm: "My goal is to help you improve."
- Stay focused: "Let's get back to the specific behavior..."

**If they're emotional:**
- Pause: "Take a moment if you need it."
- Acknowledge: "I can see this is upsetting."
- Resume when ready: "When you're ready, let's continue."

### What to Avoid
- Assuming silence means understanding
- Moving on too quickly
- Looking at notes or screen while speaking
- Using jargon or complex language

## L3: Leave Yourself Out - Focusing on the Subordinate

### Common Supervisor Emotions

**Guilt:**
- "I should have given this feedback earlier"
- "I haven't been a good enough manager"
- "This is partly my fault"

**Anxiety:**
- "What if they get angry?"
- "What if they quit?"
- "What if I'm wrong?"

**Insecurity:**
- "Who am I to judge them?"
- "I'm not perfect either"
- "They might criticize me back"

### Techniques for Leaving Yourself Out

**Before the review:**
- Remind yourself: This is about their performance, not your feelings
- Prepare thoroughly so you feel confident
- Acknowledge your emotions but don't act on them

**During the review:**
- Focus on facts and behaviors, not your reactions
- Use "I" statements for observations, not feelings: "I observed that..." not "I feel that..."
- If emotions arise, take a breath and refocus

**After the review:**
- Debrief with a peer or mentor if needed
- Reflect on what you learned
- Plan for follow-up

### What to Avoid
- Making it about your discomfort ("This is hard for me to say...")
- Apologizing for giving feedback
- Sharing your own similar struggles (unless relevant and brief)
- Seeking reassurance from the subordinate

### The "Day in Court" Mindset

The performance review is the subordinate's day in court:
- They deserve to hear the case clearly
- They deserve to understand the evidence
- They deserve to know the judgment
- They deserve a chance to respond

Your role is judge, not defendant. Stay in your role.
