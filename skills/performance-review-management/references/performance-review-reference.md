# Performance Review Variables

## Key Variables
- **Worksheet**: The unfiltered list of performance items generated during brainstorming
- **Messages**: Key themes or patterns identified from worksheet relationships (e.g., "Good results on planning system")
- **Subordinate_Response**: Verbal and nonverbal feedback from subordinate during review
- **Supervisor_Emotion**: The reviewer's feelings such as insecurity, anxiety, or guilt

## Communication Barriers

### Signs Subordinate is Not Listening
- Too emotional to understand clear points
- Preoccupied trying to formulate answers
- Tuned out (defense mechanism)
- Lack of eye contact
- Inappropriate verbal/nonverbal responses

### Signs Supervisor is Not "Leaving Themselves Out"
- Bringing up own anxieties
- Expressing guilt about feedback
- Making the review about supervisor's feelings
- Avoiding eye contact due to discomfort

## Message Examples

### Well-Formulated Messages
- "Your planning system work has been excellent, but your follow-through on execution needs improvement"
- "You consistently meet quarterly objectives, but team collaboration is an area for growth"

### Poorly Formulated Messages
- "You're doing okay, I guess" (not frank)
- "We need to work on your attitude" (vague, no examples)
- "I feel bad about saying this, but..." (supervisor emotion included)
