# Performance Review Worksheet Template

## Instructions
1. Sit with a blank piece of paper
2. Write EVERYTHING down regarding subordinate's performance
3. Do NOT edit in your head
4. Include things major, minor, and trivial
5. No particular order needed
6. Remember: Writing items down does not commit you to doing anything

## Worksheet Sections

### Performance Items
[Write all items here - good, bad, neutral, major, minor, trivial]

### Relationships Identified
[Look for patterns - are items different manifestations of the same phenomenon?]

### Messages to Deliver
[Convert relationships into key messages for subordinate]

### Supporting Evidence
[Draw conclusions and specific examples to support each message]

### Filtering Decision
[Can subordinate remember all these messages? Delete less important ones if needed]

## Handling Surprises
If the worksheet reveals a message that "startles you":
- You must deliver it to improve performance
- Action: "Swallow hard and bring it up"
