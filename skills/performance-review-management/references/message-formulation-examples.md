# Performance Review Message Formulation Examples

## Example 1: From Worksheet Items to Message

### Worksheet Items (Brainstormed)
- Missed deadline on Q3 report
- Great presentation at client meeting
- Always late to Monday staff meetings
- Helped new hire get up to speed
- Quality of code reviews has declined
- Proactive in identifying system risks

### Relationship Analysis
- Missed deadline + declined code quality = Possible burnout or distraction
- Great presentation + proactive risk ID = Strong communication skills
- Late to meetings + helping new hire = May be overcommitted

### Formulated Messages
1. **Communication Strength**: Your client presentation and risk identification show excellent communication instincts.
2. **Attention to Detail Concern**: Recent missed deadlines and code review quality decline suggest you may be stretched too thin.
3. **Time Management**: Chronic lateness to meetings combined with heavy workload indicates need to prioritize better.

## Example 2: Handling a Surprise

### Worksheet Item That Startles
"Subordinate undermined my decision in team meeting - told team we wouldn't proceed with project I had already approved."

### Initial Reaction
"I can't believe they did that. This is insubordination."

### Required Action
"Swallow hard and bring it up."

### Message Formulation
"I need to discuss something difficult. In last week's meeting, you told the team the project wouldn't proceed after I had already approved it. This undermines my authority and confuses the team. I need to understand why this happened and ensure it doesn't recur."

## Filtering Guidelines

### Keep If
- Directly impacts performance
- Has specific examples to support
- Subordinate can take action on it
- Fits within 3-5 key themes total

### Defer If
- Minor issue without clear impact
- First occurrence of behavior
- Would dilute focus from more important messages
- Better addressed in regular one-on-ones

### Typical Message Count
- **Ideal**: 3-5 messages per review
- **Maximum**: 7 messages (risk of overwhelm)
- **Minimum**: 2 messages (unless performance is uniformly excellent or poor)
