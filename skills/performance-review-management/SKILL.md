# Performance Review Management

## When to Use
- When preparing for a performance review containing both positive and negative assessments
- When delivering a performance review to a subordinate
- When regular one-on-one meetings and progress reports are available as input data

## Part 1: Preparation Strategy

### Data Scanning
Review all available material:
- Progress reports
- Performance against quarterly objectives
- One-on-one meeting notes

### Brainstorming (The Worksheet)
1. Sit with a blank piece of paper
2. Write **everything down** regarding the subordinate's performance
3. Do not edit in your head; include items major, minor, and trivial in no particular order
4. Understand that writing items down does not commit you to doing anything

### Documentation Removal
Once you run out of items, **put all of your supporting documentation away**.

### Relationship Analysis
Look for relationships between items on the worksheet:
- Are items different manifestations of the same phenomenon?
- Do items explain why strengths/weaknesses exist?

### Message Formulation
Convert identified relationships into "messages" for the subordinate.

### Evidence Gathering
From the worksheet, draw conclusions and specific examples to support each message.

### Filtering
Ask yourself: Will the subordinate be able to remember all the messages chosen?
- If not, delete the less important ones
- Excluded items can be taken up in the next review

### Handling Surprises
- Ideally, regular supervision should prevent surprises
- If the worksheet reveals a message that startles you, you must deliver it to improve performance
- Action: Swallow hard and bring it up

## Part 2: Delivery - The Three L's

### 1. Level: Be Totally Frank
- Requirement: Be completely honest and direct
- Rationale: The credibility and integrity of the entire system depend on your being totally frank
- Challenge: Praising someone straightforwardly can be as difficult as criticizing without embarrassment

### 2. Listen: Ensure Message Reception
- Goal: Transmit thoughts from your brain to theirs; words are just the means, getting the right thought communicated is the end
- **Do NOT** use a tape recorder to confirm words used

#### Identify Barriers
Watch for signs that the subordinate is:
- Too emotional to understand clear points
- Preoccupied trying to formulate answers rather than listening
- Tuned out (e.g., thinking of going fishing) as a defense mechanism, especially if the message is laden with conflict

#### Verification Techniques
1. Watch the person you are talking to
2. Check for appropriate verbal and nonverbal responses
3. Check if they allow themselves to receive your message
4. **If responses do not completely assure you that the message has gotten through**: Keep at it until you are satisfied that you have been heard and understood
5. If not understood: Explain again or explain in a different way. Do not look away (like at a blackboard) to avoid confirming the presentation is murky

### 3. Leave Yourself Out: Focus on the Subordinate
- Principle: The performance review is about and for your subordinate
- Keep your own insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or other emotions out of it
- At issue are the subordinate's problems; it is the subordinate's day in court
- Control strong emotions (similar to stage fright) so they do not affect your task
