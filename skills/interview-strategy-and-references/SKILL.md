# Interview Strategy and Reference Protocol

Use this skill when planning your interview approach, conducting reference checks, or analyzing interview results to make hiring decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Completed initial interview with candidate
- List of references to contact

## Strategic Principles

### 1. Define the Ultimate Purpose

- Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance
- Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit
- Focus on how past behavior predicts future performance

### 2. Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks

- **Do not use tricks** to test character (e.g., three-legged chair)
- Be completely straightforward with the candidate
- Show yourself and the environment as they really are
- **Rationale**: A candidate is a potential employee; wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired

## Reference Checking Protocol

### Goal

Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.

### Rapport Building

- **If you know the reference personally**: You have a better chance of getting "real" information
- **If the reference is a stranger**: Keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- **Build connection**: Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

### Timing Strategy

- The **last 10 minutes** of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes
- Plan for sufficient call duration to develop the necessary bond
- Deeper information flows after rapport is established

## Follow-up Interviews

- If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks
- Clarify any discrepancies or concerns that emerged

## Acknowledge Limitations

- **Recognize**: Careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- **Accept**: The process merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well
- **High risk**: Acknowledge that failure is always possible despite thorough assessment
- **No guarantee**: There is no foolproof method to predict employee performance

## Decision Output

Make a hiring decision based on:
- Comprehensive assessment of past performance
- Information gathered from references
- Alignment with your environment and needs
- Acknowledgment of inherent risk and uncertainty
