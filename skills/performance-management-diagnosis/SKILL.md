# Performance Management Diagnosis

## When to Use
- Employee is not performing their job duties
- Diagnosing root cause of underperformance
- Deciding on performance interventions
- Making promotion decisions
- Designing selection and promotion processes

## Part 1: Employee Performance Diagnosis

### The Core Framework

When an employee is not performing, there are only **two possible root causes**:

1. **Can't do it**: The employee lacks the capability (Training issue)
2. **Won't do it**: The employee lacks the motivation (Motivation issue)

### Execution Steps

**Step 1: Identify Performance Gap**
- Observe that employee is not meeting expectations
- Confirm role and expectations are clearly defined

**Step 2: Diagnose Root Cause**
- Assess capability: Does the employee have the skills and knowledge?
- Assess motivation: Is the employee willing and engaged?
- Categorize into "Can't do" or "Won't do"

**Step 3: Select Intervention**
- **If Can't do**: Train the employee
- **If Won't do**: Motivate the employee

**Step 4: Implement and Monitor**
- Apply the selected intervention
- Monitor for improvement
- Re-diagnose if performance doesn't improve

### Critical Constraint

There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than **motivate and train**.

## Part 2: The Peter Principle

### Core Concept

"In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

### The Mechanism

1. **Selection Criteria**: Candidate is selected based on performance in their **current role**
2. **Missing Criteria**: Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"
3. **Trajectory**: Employee continues to be promoted until they reach a role they are not skilled for
4. **Outcome**: Employee stops being promoted once incompetent, resulting in managers at their level of incompetence

### Execution Steps for Prevention

**Step 1: Analyze Selection Criteria**
- Review how candidates are selected for positions
- Identify if current role performance is the primary factor

**Step 2: Assess Intended Role Requirements**
- Define specific competencies required for the new position
- Compare with current role competencies

**Step 3: Evaluate Candidate Fit**
- Assess candidate's abilities against intended role requirements
- Don't assume current success predicts future success

**Step 4: Make Promotion Decision**
- Base decision on competencies for the intended role
- Consider skill gaps and development needs

### When the Principle Applies

- Hierarchical promotion structure exists
- Selection decisions are based on past performance data
- Skills required for new role differ from current role

### When the Principle Does NOT Apply

- Selection is based on competencies specific to the intended role
- Skills required for the new role are identical to the current role
- Promotion is not the only advancement path

## Constraints

- Employee Performance Diagnosis: Assumes role and expectations are clearly defined
- Peter Principle: Does not apply if selection is based on intended role competencies

## Key Variables

- **Performance_Root_Cause**: Either 'Capability' (Can't) or 'Motivation' (Won't)
- **current_role_performance**: Candidate's demonstrated success in existing position
- **intended_role_abilities**: Specific skills required for the new position

## Result Templates

**Performance Diagnosis**: Directs the manager to either provide Training or Motivation based on the diagnosis

**Peter Principle**: Identification of a management level where the individual's competence is insufficient, explaining why they remain in that role
