# Training Strategy and ROI

Execute high-leverage, manager-led training that increases organizational output while ensuring cultural alignment and appropriate resource allocation.

## Core Principles

### Manager's Output Definition

A manager's output = **the output of their organization—no more, no less.**

### Performance Levers

To increase individual performance, use two principal means:
1. Increasing motivation (desire to do the job well)
2. Increasing individual capability (via training)

> **Critical Insight:** Just as motivation cannot be fully delegated, neither should training be delegated solely to specialists.

## Who Should Train

### Assign the Trainer Role

- **The manager (you)** must instruct direct subordinates and next few ranks below
- **Rationale:** Training must be performed by a "suitable role model" who is a "believable, practicing authority"
- **Constraint:** Proxies, regardless of subject matter expertise, cannot fill this role effectively

### Manager Must Be the Trainer

- Avoid delegating training to specialists
- Manager's operational knowledge and subject matter expertise are required
- Training content must align with company culture

## ROI Calculation

### Preparation Ratio

- **Standard:** 3 hours of preparation for every 1 hour of course time

### Example ROI Analysis

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Course length | 4 lectures (4 hours) |
| Manager preparation | 12 hours (3:1 ratio) |
| Students trained | 10 |
| Total student work hours/year | ~20,000 hours |
| Performance improvement needed | 1% |
| **Organizational gain** | **200 hours** (1% of 20,000) |
| **Manager investment** | **12 hours** |
| **Net gain** | **188 hours** |

## Training Volume Assessment

### Task Classification

**Task 1: New Member Training**
- Teaching new members skills needed to perform their jobs

**Task 2: New Skill Training**
- Teaching new ideas, principles, or skills to present members

### Calculate Training Load

**Task 1 Formula:**
```
Annual Training Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)
```

**Example:** Department with 10% turnover + 10% growth = 20% training load

**Task 2 Magnitude:**
```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

**Example:** If Task 1 load is 20%, Task 2 is 5 times larger (100% / 20%)

### Cost and Feasibility

- Calculate cost based on student time
- **Benchmark:** One-day course for middle-management can cost >$1,000,000 in student time alone
- **Decision Rule:** Do not enter Task 2 (training all staff) lightly due to high magnitude and cost

## Curriculum Scope

### Maintain a Course Catalogue

Cover range from basic skills to complex technical skills:
- Basic: Telephone manners
- Technical: Ion implanter operation (~200 hours)
- Management: Strategic planning, constructive confrontation, performance reviews, productive meetings

### Time Allocation

- Allocate approximately **2% to 4%** of employee time to classroom learning

## Critical Implementation Requirements

### 1. Cultural Alignment

- **Avoid** "highly structured and academic" approaches if they contradict company practices
- **Example:** If company tradition is "free market" with self-driven job applications, do not teach "carefully coordinated job rotations" or long-term career plans
- **Warning:** Mismatch between teaching and practice demoralizes participants

### 2. Consistency (Process vs. Event)

- Training must be a **process, not an event**
- Provide a "reliable, consistent presence" that is "systematic and scheduled"
- **Do NOT** use training as a "rescue effort summoned to solve the problem of the moment"

### 3. Timing

- Pay bonus close enough to work time so subordinate remembers why it was awarded
- Account for cause/effect time offsets

## Risks of Insufficient Training

Failure to train employees to recognize specific conditions leads to:
- Inefficiencies
- Excess costs
- Unhappy customers
- Danger

**Example:** Untrained operator caused >$1M in scrapped material and delivery slips
