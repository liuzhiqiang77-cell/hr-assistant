# Presentation Guidelines for Operation Reviews

## Visual Aids
- Use overhead transparencies, tables, numbers, graphics
- Engage eyes and ears simultaneously
- Highlight emphasis with color pen or pointer

## Timing Rule
- **4 minutes per visual aid** (including discussion)
- Example: 10 visual aids = 40 minutes total

## Audience Monitoring
Watch for these indicators:
- **Engagement**: Leaning forward, nodding, eye contact
- **Confusion**: Furrowed brows, looking away, whispering
- **Disengagement**: Yawning, reading, checking phone

**Response**: Adjust speed, clarify points, or ask for questions.
