# Operation Review Best Practices

## Visual Aid Guidelines

### Effective Visual Aids
- Tables with clear headers
- Numbers with trends highlighted
- Graphics showing relationships
- Key metrics prominently displayed

### Ineffective Visual Aids
- Walls of text
- Too much data per slide
- Unclear labels or legends
- Poor color contrast

### Presentation Tips
- Point to specific data being discussed
- Use color to draw attention to key points
- Face audience, not screen
- Explain what the data means, not just what it is

## Time Management

### Organizing Manager Signals
- **5 minutes remaining**: Hold up 5 fingers
- **2 minutes remaining**: Hold up 2 fingers
- **Time's up**: Subtle hand wave or nod

### Handling Time Overruns
- If presenter is running long, organizing manager should:
  1. Signal time remaining
  2. If signal ignored, step in politely: "We have 2 more minutes for this visual"
  3. If still ignored, interject: "Let's move to the next visual to stay on schedule"

## Audience Participation

### Good Questions
- "What drove that trend?"
- "How does this compare to last quarter?"
- "What are you doing to address this issue?"
- "What help do you need?"

### Poor Questions
- Questions that could have been answered by reading the visual
- Questions that embarrass the presenter
- Questions unrelated to the topic
- Questions that show you weren't paying attention

### Correcting Factual Errors
- Do it publicly and respectfully
- "I think there might be a small error in that number..."
- "Actually, the data shows..."
- Don't let errors stand uncorrected
- Focus on accuracy, not blame

## Reviewing Manager Preparation

### What NOT to Do
- Don't preview the presentation materials
- Don't coordinate questions in advance
- Don't rehearse reactions

### What TO Do
- Come with open mind
- Be ready to learn
- Model engagement for audience
- Take role as catalyst seriously
