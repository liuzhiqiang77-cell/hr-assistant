# Visual Aid Best Practices for Operation Reviews

## Types of Visual Aids
- Tables with numerical data
- Charts and graphs
- Process diagrams
- Summary slides

## Design Principles
1. **One Concept Per Visual**: Focus on a single key message
2. **Readability**: Ensure text is large enough to be read from the back of the room
3. **Simplicity**: Avoid clutter—less is more
4. **Color Usage**: Use color strategically to highlight emphasis points

## Presentation Tips
1. **Face the Audience**: Don't talk to the screen
2. **Use a Pointer**: Guide attention to specific data points
3. **Allow Processing Time**: Pause after showing complex visuals
4. **Explain, Don't Read**: Elaborate on what the visual means, don't just read the numbers

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Too much text on a single slide
- Small fonts that can't be read
- Reading directly from the visual
- Not allowing time for questions on each visual
- Moving too quickly through complex data
