# Presentation Time Calculation

## Rule of Thumb
4 minutes per visual aid (tables, numbers, graphics)

## Formula
total_time = visual_aids_count × 4 minutes

## Example
10 transparencies × 4 minutes = 40 minutes total presentation time

## Visual Aid Guidelines
- Engage eyes and ears simultaneously
- Use color pens or pointers for emphasis
- Monitor audience body language continuously ("like a hawk")
- Adjust speed based on audience feedback
