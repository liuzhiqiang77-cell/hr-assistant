# Presentation Timing Rule

## Rule of Thumb

**Allow four minutes of presentation and discussion time per visual aid**

## Visual Aids Include
- Tables
- Numbers
- Graphics
- Overhead transparencies

## Calculation

```
Total Time = Number of Visual Aids × 4 minutes
```

## Examples
- 10 visual aids = 40 minutes
- 15 visual aids = 60 minutes
- 20 visual aids = 80 minutes

## Presenter Responsibilities
- Engage eyes and ears simultaneously
- Highlight emphasis using color pen or pointer
- Monitor audience "like a hawk" using facial expressions and body language
- Adjust speed or clarify points based on audience reactions
