# Operation Review Management

## When to Use This Skill
- Facilitating interaction between employees several organizational levels apart
- When participants lack regular one-on-one meetings or staff meetings
- When cross-level teaching and learning is needed

**Do NOT use**:
- For immediate supervisor-subordinate one-on-ones
- For routine staff meetings

## Define the Purpose
Facilitate teaching and learning between employees several organizational levels apart who lack regular interaction channels. This provides:
- Motivation for presenters to impress supervisors' supervisors
- Opportunity for peer learning
- Cross-level knowledge transfer

## Role Assignments and Execution

### Organizing Manager (Supervisor)
**Responsibilities**:
- Decide what issues to discuss, emphasize, and the level of detail
- Handle housekeeping (room, visuals, invitations)
- Act as timekeeper: Schedule presentations and keep them moving

**Technique**: Use inconspicuous gestures to prevent running out of time.

### Reviewing Manager (Senior Supervisor)
**Responsibilities**:
- Ask questions, make comments, and impart the appropriate spirit
- Act as a catalyst to provoke audience participation
- Encourage free expression by example

**Critical Rule**: NEVER preview the material to ensure spontaneous reaction.

**Attitude**: Take the role seriously as a model for junior managers.

### Presenters
**Responsibilities**:
- Use visual aids (overhead transparencies) to engage eyes and ears simultaneously
- Highlight emphasis using a color pen or pointer
- Monitor the audience "like a hawk" using facial expressions and body language
- Adjust speed or clarify points based on audience reactions

**Rule of Thumb**: Allow four minutes of presentation and discussion time per visual aid (tables, numbers, graphics).

### Audience
**Responsibilities**:
- Participate actively by asking questions and making comments
- Correct factual errors publicly (it is your responsibility)
- Regard attendance as work, not a "siesta"

**Avoid These Behaviors**:
- Avoiding eye contact
- Yawning
- Reading newspapers
- Any disengagement that undermines presenter confidence

## Time Calculation
`Total Time = Number of Visual Aids × 4 minutes`

## Expected Outcome
A conducted review where junior managers receive feedback and senior managers gain detailed problem insights.
