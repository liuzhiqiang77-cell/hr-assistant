# Promotion and Career Management

## Promotion Performance Cycle Logic

### The Performance-Promotion Cycle

1. **Initial State**: Employee starts at Job 1 performing at "average" level ("meets the requirements")

2. **Improvement Phase**: With training and motivation, employee improves to "above-average" level ("exceeds the requirements")

3. **Promotion Trigger**: Once employee "exceeds the requirements," they are considered "promotable" and are promoted to Job 2

4. **Performance Reset**: Upon entering Job 2, employee initially performs only at "meets requirements" level due to new challenges

5. **Cycle Repetition**: With experience, employee again improves to "exceeds requirements," leading to another promotion

6. **Cycle Conclusion**: Cycle repeats until employee settles at "meets requirements" and is no longer promoted (reaching their "level of incompetence")

### Critical Constraint: The Atrophy Risk

If an employee "exceeds the requirements" but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will **atrophy** and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements."

### Decision Rule

- **Promote** when performance rating = "exceeds requirements"
- **Maintain** current level when performance = "meets requirements"

## Employee Recycling Procedure

Use this when a promoted employee performs below-average for an extended period.

### Identification

Recognize that a person has been promoted into a position "so much over their head" that they perform below-average for an extended time.

### Solution: Recycling

**Definition**: Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Solution Selection**: Choose to "recycle" the employee rather than terminate them

2. **Management Accountability**: Management must admit it was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness" for more responsibility

3. **Implementation**: Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do

4. **Support System**: Support the employee in the face of likely "embarrassment"

5. **Transparency**: Execute the recycling "openly" to reduce stigma

### Expected Outcome

- Embarrassment will be "short-lived"
- Employee will regain confidence
- Once confidence is regained, employee becomes an "excellent candidate for another promotion" at a later time and is likely to succeed

### Prohibited Action

**Do NOT** force the employee to leave the company. Reject the rationalization that "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake."

## Promotion Eligibility Assessment

### Required Capabilities

1. **Clear and concise breakdown of problems**
2. **Identification of goals**
3. **Establishment of the way to achieve those goals**
4. **Ability to be the primary driver** on complex projects (supervisor helps only when needed)

### Independence Requirement

- Employee must be the "primary driver"
- Promotion is contingent on demonstrating capability for independent work

### Promotion Decision

- **Eligible**: If all required capabilities demonstrated
- **Not Eligible**: If specific criteria are not met, regardless of desire

## When to Use This Skill

- Evaluating employees for promotion
- Designing career progression systems
- Addressing chronic underperformance after promotion
- Determining when to recycle vs. terminate employees
- Assessing promotion readiness for complex roles

## Constraints

- Does not apply to "noncompetitors" who have no motivation to do more
- Requires overcoming societal stigma regarding demotion
- Requires management to accept accountability for misjudgments
