# Competitive Scoring System Examples

## Facility Management Example
**Context**: Multiple buildings requiring maintenance

**Implementation**:
- Assign a "building czar" for each location
- Create scoring criteria (cleanliness, response time, cost efficiency)
- Weekly scores posted publicly
- Buildings compared against each other

**Result**: Immediate improvement without monetary rewards

## Sales Team Example
**Context**: Regional sales teams

**Scoring Metrics**:
- Revenue generated (weighted 40%)
- New client acquisition (weighted 30%)
- Client retention rate (weighted 20%)
- Team collaboration score (weighted 10%)

**Visibility**:
- Real-time dashboard updated daily
- Weekly leaderboard emailed to all
- Monthly recognition ceremony

## Software Development Example
**Context**: Development squads

**Scoring Metrics**:
- Features delivered on time (weighted 35%)
- Bug count in production (weighted 25%)
- Code review participation (weighted 20%)
- Peer help requests resolved (weighted 20%)

**Visibility**:
- Sprint burndown charts public
- Quality metrics displayed in team area
- Quarterly "hackathon" competitions

## Key Design Principles
1. **Metrics must be objective** - minimize subjectivity
2. **Update frequency matters** - daily or weekly is better than monthly
3. **Public visibility is essential** - scores must be seen by peers
4. **Balance multiple dimensions** - avoid single-metric competition
5. **Keep it simple** - 3-5 metrics maximum

## Avoiding Toxic Competition

**Warning Signs**:
- Withholding information from peers
- Sabotaging others' work
- Gaming the metrics
- Personal attacks or hostility

**Prevention Measures**:
- Include collaboration metrics in scoring
- Reward team success, not just individual
- Zero tolerance for sabotage
- Regular check-ins on team dynamics
- Emphasize "rising tide lifts all boats"
