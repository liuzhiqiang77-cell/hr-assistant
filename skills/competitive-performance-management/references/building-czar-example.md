# Case Study: Building Czar Scoring System

## Problem
Facility maintenance across multiple buildings was inconsistent. No monetary budget available for incentives.

## Solution

### Role Creation
- Appointed a "building czar" for each facility
- Role carried authority but no additional compensation

### Scoring System
- Created specific maintenance criteria (cleanliness, repair response time, safety compliance)
- Each building scored weekly on 0-100 scale
- Scores posted publicly in central location

### Competition Element
- Buildings ranked against each other
- "Top building" recognized in company meeting
- No monetary prize, only recognition and status

## Results

**Immediate Improvement**:
- Maintenance scores increased 40% in first month
- Buildings in bottom quartile improved most dramatically

**Sustained Motivation**:
- Improvement continued for 18+ months without additional incentives
- Building czars developed friendly rivalries
- Knowledge sharing increased (top performers shared techniques)

**Cost**:
- Zero additional monetary cost
- Time investment: weekly scoring (30 minutes), monthly recognition (5 minutes)

## Key Success Factors
1. **Visible Metrics**: Scores posted publicly created transparency
2. **Clear Criteria**: Everyone knew exactly what was measured
3. **Peer Comparison**: Ranking against peers drove improvement
4. **Recognition**: Status and pride were sufficient rewards
5. **Fairness**: Same criteria applied to all buildings
