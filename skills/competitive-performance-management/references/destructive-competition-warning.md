## Ensuring Constructive Competition

**Design Principles**:
1. **Individual Metrics**: Score based on individual performance, not zero-sum against others
2. **Absolute Standards**: Include benchmarks against standards, not just peers
3. **Collaboration Incentives**: Reward helping others improve
4. **Transparency**: Make scoring methodology visible and unquestionable
5. **Fairness**: Ensure all participants have similar resources and opportunities

**Manager's Role**:
- Monitor for destructive behaviors
- Intervene early if competition turns toxic
- Reinforce that "we all win when the team wins"
- Celebrate collective improvement, not just individual winners

**When to Avoid Competition**:
- Highly interdependent work where individual metrics are impossible
- Teams with existing trust issues or conflict
- Cultures with extreme individualism
- Novice learners who need support, not pressure
