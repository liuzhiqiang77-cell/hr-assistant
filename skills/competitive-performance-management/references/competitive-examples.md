# Competitive Management Examples

## Building Czar Example

A facilities management team implemented a competitive scoring system:
- Each building was assigned a "czar" responsible for maintenance quality
- Buildings were scored on standardized metrics (cleanliness, repair response time, etc.)
- Scores were posted publicly, creating immediate competition between buildings
- Result: Significant improvement in maintenance quality without additional monetary rewards

## Fear Management

### Positive Fear of Failure
- Athletes before a competition: "I don't want to lose"
- Drives preparation and focus
- Results in peak performance

### Negative Fear of Failure
- Avoiding challenging projects to ensure success
- Conservative decision-making
- Results in stagnation and underperformance

### Manager's Role
- Channel fear into preparation, not avoidance
- Emphasize that failure is part of growth
- Celebrate effort and learning, not just wins

## When Competition Fails

- Mergers that eliminate competitive benchmarks
- Teams that turn competition into sabotage
- Individuals who cannot handle public comparison
- Situations where metrics are gamed rather than improved
