# Interview Strategy and Reference Protocol

## When to Use
- Planning interview strategy and approach before candidate interactions
- Conducting reference checks after initial interviews
- Performing post-interview analysis and decision-making
- Setting expectations about hiring success rates

## Core Workflow

### 1. Define Ultimate Purpose
Keep the primary goal clear throughout the process:
- **Judge potential contribution** in a new environment by projecting past performance
- **Move between worlds**: Assess how the candidate's past employer environment compares to yours
- **Evaluate fit**: Determine if their past performance indicates success in your context

### 2. Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks
Adopt a straightforward approach throughout the hiring process:

**Do NOT use tricks:**
- No "trick" tests of character (e.g., three-legged chair, stress tests)
- No deceptive scenarios or false information

**DO be transparent:**
- Show yourself and the work environment as they really are
- Provide accurate information about the role, team, and company
- Set realistic expectations from the start

**Rationale:**
- The candidate is a potential employee and colleague
- Wrong first impressions take significant time to correct if hired
- Honesty builds trust and attracts candidates who value transparency

### 3. Execute Reference Checking
Conduct thorough reference checks to validate candidate information.

**Goal:**
- Obtain the same information you sought from the candidate, but from an external source
- Corroborate or question the candidate's self-assessment

**Build Rapport:**
- **Personal connection**: If you know the reference personally, leverage this relationship to get candid information
- **Stranger approach**: If the reference is unknown, invest time in building a personal bond
- **Find common ground**: Uncover shared experiences or associations to increase openness
- **Timing matters**: The last 10 minutes of a 30-minute conversation are more valuable than the first 10

**Reference check questions should explore:**
- Past performance and achievements
- Technical and interpersonal skills
- Areas for improvement
- Work style and cultural fit
- Reasons for leaving

### 4. Conduct Follow-up Interviews
If possible and appropriate:
- Schedule a second conversation with the applicant after reference checks
- Address new perspectives or concerns uncovered during reference calls
- Ask follow-up questions based on reference feedback
- Give the candidate opportunity to explain any discrepancies

### 5. Acknowledge Limitations
Maintain realistic expectations about the hiring process:

**Recognize:**
- Careful interviewing does not guarantee hiring success
- Even with excellent technique and thorough reference checks, failures occur
- The process only increases the probability of making a good decision

**Accept:**
- Interviewing is about "increasing the odds" of getting lucky
- No interview technique eliminates all hiring risk
- Continuous improvement of the process is necessary but never perfect

## Output
A hiring decision based on:
- Comprehensive assessment of candidate's past performance
- Validation through reference checks
- Strategic alignment with organizational needs
- Acknowledged risk and probability of success
