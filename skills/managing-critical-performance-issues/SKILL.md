# Managing Critical Performance Issues ('Blast' Process)

## When to Use
Use when a subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing. Requires that the manager possesses facts and examples.

## Resistance Cycle Stages

### Stage 1: Ignore
Passive ignoring of the problem.

### Stage 2: Deny
Active denial of the problem's existence.

### Stage 3: Blame Others
Admits problem exists but blames others to avoid responsibility.

### Stage 4: Assume Responsibility (CRITICAL)
Admits "It is my problem." This is an **emotional step** where the subordinate realizes "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it." This is the hardest step.

### Stage 5: Find Solution
Intellectual step to remedy the situation. Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task and relatively easier.

## Facilitation Process

### Progression Through Stages
1. **Use facts and examples** to demonstrate reality (moving from Ignore to Deny)
2. **Use evidence** to overcome resistance (moving from Deny to Blame Others)
3. **Guide the subordinate** to take the "biggest step" of Assuming Responsibility
4. **Collaborate** on finding the solution once responsibility is assumed

### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')
If the subordinate cannot progress past blaming others:

1. **Assume formal role:** Take the role of supervisor endowed with position power
2. **State clearly:** "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. **Acknowledge disagreement:** "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. **Assert organizational requirement:** "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. **Secure commitment:** Obtain the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. **Monitor performance:** Track performance against that commitment

## Possible Outcomes
1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

## Variables
- **current_stage** (enum): Ignore, Deny, Blame Others, Assume Responsibility, Find Solution
- **evidence_available** (boolean): Whether sufficient facts and examples exist

## Critical Distinction
- **Assuming Responsibility** is an emotional step (hard)
- **Finding Solution** is an intellectual step (easier)
