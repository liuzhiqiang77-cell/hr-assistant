# Comprehensive Candidate Evaluation

This skill provides a structured approach to evaluating job candidates through interviews and reference checks, emphasizing honest assessment and strategic questioning.

## When to Use
- Conducting interviews with job candidates
- Checking candidate references
- Planning interview strategy
- Making hiring decisions
- Conducting follow-up interviews

## Core Principles

### Maintain Honesty
- Do not use tricks or artificial tests to assess character
- Present yourself and the company environment accurately
- Wrong first impressions take significant time to correct if the candidate is hired
- Treat the candidate as a potential future employee from the start

### Acknowledge Limitations
- Careful interviewing increases odds of success but does not guarantee it
- Reference checks and interviews provide insight, not certainty
- Accept that some hiring decisions will not work out despite thorough evaluation

## Interview Process

### Step 1: Conduct the Interview

Use multiple questioning techniques to assess the candidate:

1. **Ask Recommended Questions**
   - "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
   - "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
   - "Convince me why my company should hire you."
   - "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
   - "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"
   - "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

2. **Use Direct Questions**
   - Ask blunt questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?")
   - Observe the candidate's reaction and confidence level
   - Note timidity or hesitation as indicators of actual capability

3. **Employ Hypothetical Situations**
   - Walk the candidate through a job-relevant process
   - Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result
   - Assess their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly

4. **Invite Candidate Questions**
   - Ask what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job
   - Analyze their questions to determine their knowledge, values, and preparation level

### Step 2: Check References

**Goal:** Obtain the same information you sought from the candidate directly.

1. **Build Rapport**
   - If you know the reference personally, leverage that connection
   - If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
   - Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

2. **Time the Call Effectively**
   - The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes
   - Extended conversation allows the reference to become more comfortable and candid

### Step 3: Conduct Follow-up Interviews

- If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from reference checks
- Clarify any discrepancies or concerns identified

### Step 4: Make Hiring Decision

- Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance
- Consider the fit between the candidate's previous environment and yours
- Weigh all assessment inputs: interview responses, hypothetical solutions, reference feedback, and your own judgment

## Assessment Categories

Evaluate candidates across these dimensions:

- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, technical proficiency, self-assessed weaknesses
- **Application of Knowledge**: Past achievements, learning from failures
- **Problem-Solving**: Current problems and solutions, preventive measures
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new role, motivation, alignment with company needs
