# Reference Check Protocol

## Preparation

1. **Gather Reference Information**
   - Names, titles, and relationship to candidate
   - Company and contact information
   - Dates of overlap with candidate

2. **Review Candidate Responses**
   - Note areas where candidate self-assessed
   - Identify claims to verify with references
   - Prepare specific questions based on interview gaps

## Call Structure

### Opening (Minutes 0-5)
- Introduce yourself and your role
- Explain the position the candidate applied for
- Ask if this is a good time to talk
- Set expectations for call length (request 30 minutes)

### Information Gathering (Minutes 5-20)
- Confirm dates of employment and reporting relationship
- Ask about candidate's key responsibilities
- Inquire about specific projects or achievements mentioned in interview

### Deep Dive (Minutes 20-30)
- **Most valuable portion** - rapport should be established
- Ask about candidate's weaknesses or areas for development
- Inquire about reasons for leaving
- Ask "Would you hire this person again? Why or why not?"
- Ask "Is there anything I should know that I haven't asked?"

## Rapport Building Techniques

### If You Know the Reference
- Open with personal connection
- Reference shared experiences or mutual contacts
- Leverage existing trust to get candid feedback

### If the Reference is a Stranger
- Find common ground (industry, geography, alumni associations)
- Share your own perspective on the role and company
- Listen actively and show understanding of their context
- Extend the call beyond the minimum necessary time
- Ask follow-up questions to demonstrate genuine interest

## Key Questions to Ask References

1. "In what capacity did you work with [candidate]?"
2. "What were [candidate]'s primary responsibilities?"
3. "Can you describe a significant project [candidate] worked on?"
4. "What would you consider [candidate]'s greatest strengths?"
5. "What areas did [candidate] need to develop?"
6. "How did [candidate] handle feedback or criticism?"
7. "How does [candidate] work under pressure or tight deadlines?"
8. "Would you hire [candidate] again? Why or why not?"
9. "Is there anything else I should know about [candidate]?"

## Red Flags in References

- Reluctance to provide specific examples
- Consistently vague or generic praise
- Hesitation before answering critical questions
- Reference who seems coached or rehearsed
- Discrepancies between reference feedback and candidate claims

## Documentation

- Record key points immediately after each call
- Note direct quotes when possible
- Document any discrepancies to address in follow-up interview
- Rate the reference's credibility based on rapport and specificity
