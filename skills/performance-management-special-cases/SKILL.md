description: Handle major performance problems requiring turnaround using the 'Blast' process (guiding through resistance cycle) and develop high achievers with future-focused guidance. Use when an employee has severe performance issues risking termination or is a top performer needing growth guidance.

# Performance Management Special Cases

## When to Use
- Subordinate has major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing
- Subordinate is stuck in denial, blaming others, or ignoring the problem
- Subordinate is a high achiever and needs future development beyond retrospective review
- Standard review approaches are insufficient for the situation

## The 'Blast' Process for Major Performance Problems

Identify and guide the subordinate through the resistance cycle:

### Resistance Cycle Stages
1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others to avoid responsibility
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (EMOTIONAL STEP - hardest part)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation (easier once responsibility taken)

### Facilitation Approach
- **Ignore → Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
- **Deny → Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance
- **Blame Others → Responsibility**: Guide to take the biggest step. This is emotional work where subordinate realizes "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it" - implying work and unpleasantness
- **Responsibility → Solution**: Once responsibility is assumed, finding solutions is shared task and relatively easier (intellectual step)

### Possible Outcomes
1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (If stuck at 'Blame Others')
Assume formal supervisor role with position power:

1. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do"
2. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right"
3. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do"
4. Secure commitment to the course of action
5. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development

High achievers account for disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a high-leverage activity.

### Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying superior performance judgment while giving little attention to how subordinate could do even better. Poor performers receive detailed "corrective action programs" (step-by-step affairs to meet minimum requirements), whereas high achievers often lack future-oriented guidance.

### Development Approach
1. Analyze current review content for the high achiever
2. Identify if review is purely retrospective (analyzing what they did prior year) or justifying a high rating
3. **Shift priority**: Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to improve performance or maintain current level
4. Provide detailed future-oriented guidance, not just past justification
5. Recognize that improving high achievers is high-leverage - impact on group output is very great
