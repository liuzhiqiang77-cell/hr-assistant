# Compensation and Promotion Management

## When to Use This Skill
- Designing or reviewing compensation structures for managers
- Evaluating employees for promotion
- Handling underperforming promoted employees
- Managing career progression and development

## Middle Manager Compensation System Design

### Step 1: Design Performance Bonus (Variable Pay)

#### Determine Bonus Percentage
| Manager Level | Bonus Percentage | Rationale |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| Middle Manager | 10% to 25% of total compensation | Higher earners need higher percentage for feedback |
| Senior Manager | Up to 50% of total compensation | Avoids hardship from fluctuations |

#### Define Bonus Factors
Identify if performance is Team-based or Individual-based.

**Recommended 3-Factor Split** (e.g., for 20% total comp):
1. Individual Performance (judged by supervisor)
2. Immediate Team Objective Performance (e.g., department)
3. Overall Corporate Financial Performance

#### Establish Timing
- Pay bonus close enough to the work time so the subordinate remembers why it was awarded
- Account for cause/effect time offsets

#### Select Metrics
- **Countable items**: Financial metrics
- **Measurable objectives**: KPIs, OKRs
- **Subjective elements**: Use with caution (may lead to "beauty contest")

### Step 2: Design Salary Administration (Base Pay)

#### Select Administration Scheme

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| A: Experience-Only | Pay based strictly on time | Easiest | Ignores merit |
| B: Merit-Only | Pay based on performance | Rewards excellence | Hard to ignore experience |
| C: Compromise (Recommended) | "Family of curves" | Balances both | More complex |

**Implement Compromise (Family of Curves)**:
- Start everyone at same salary level
- Individuals move up at different speeds based on performance
- Shape approximates experience-only curve but allows variance

#### Implement Competitive Ranking
- Merit-based systems require competitive, comparative evaluation
- **Principle**: If someone is first, someone else must be last (similar to sports rankings)

## Promotion Performance Cycle Logic

### Step 1: Assess Current Performance
- **Meets Requirements**: Average performance at current job level
- **Exceeds Requirements**: Above-average performance at current job level

### Step 2: Apply Promotion Trigger
- Once employee "exceeds the requirements", they are considered "promotable"
- Promote to next job level (Job 2)

### Step 3: Understand Performance Reset
- Upon entering Job 2, employee initially performs at "meets requirements" level due to new challenges
- With experience, employee improves to "exceeds requirements"
- Cycle repeats until employee settles at "meets requirements" (reaching their "level of incompetence")

### Step 4: Apply Critical Constraint
**If an employee "exceeds the requirements" but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will "atrophy" and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements."**

## Employee Recycling Procedure

**Use when**: A promoted employee performs below-average for an extended time.

### Step 1: Identification
Recognize that a person has been promoted into a position "so much over his head" that they perform below-average for an extended time.

### Step 2: Choose Recycling
Choose to "recycle" the employee rather than terminate them.

### Step 3: Define Recycling
Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion.

### Step 4: Management Accountability
Management must admit it was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness" for more responsibility.

### Step 5: Implementation
- Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do
- Support the employee in the face of likely "embarrassment"
- Execute the recycling "openly" to reduce stigma

### Step 6: Expected Outcome
- Embarrassment will be "short-lived"
- Employee will regain confidence
- Employee becomes an "excellent candidate for another promotion" at a later time

### Step 7: Prohibited Action
**Do NOT** force the employee to leave the company. Reject the rationalization that "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake."

## Constraints
- Do not pay out lavishly if the company is going bankrupt
- Finite money resource requires allocation choices
- Performance is hard to assess precisely for middle managers (not paid by piece, woven into team)
- Does not apply to 'noncompetitors' who have no motivation to do more
- Societal stigma regarding demotion must be overcome
