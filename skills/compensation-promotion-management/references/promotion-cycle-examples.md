# Promotion Cycle Examples

## Example 1: Successful Promotion Cycle

**Engineer Level 1 → Engineer Level 2**

| Phase | Performance | Duration | Action |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Initial | Meets Requirements | 0-12 months | Learning role |
| Improvement | Exceeds Requirements | 12-24 months | Demonstrating mastery |
| Promotion | - | Month 24 | Promoted to Level 2 |
| Reset | Meets Requirements | 24-36 months | Learning new challenges |
| Improvement | Exceeds Requirements | 36-48 months | Mastering Level 2 |
| Promotion | - | Month 48 | Promoted to Senior Engineer |

## Example 2: Atrophy Risk

**Marketing Manager Stagnation**

| Timeline | Performance | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Year 1-2 | Meets Requirements | Learning role |
| Year 3-4 | Exceeds Requirements | Ready for promotion |
| Year 5-6 | Exceeds Requirements | **NO PROMOTION AVAILABLE** |
| Year 7-8 | Meets Requirements | **Atrophy occurred** |

**Problem**: Employee was not promoted when ready, lost motivation, performance returned to baseline.

**Solution**: Either promote immediately or accept that performance will not return to previous peak.

## Example 3: Employee Recycling

**Situation**: Sarah was promoted from Sales Rep to Sales Manager. After 8 months, her team is underperforming and she's overwhelmed.

**Assessment**:
- Previous role: Top-performing Sales Rep (exceeded requirements)
- Current role: Below-average Sales Manager (does not meet requirements)
- Duration: 8 months of poor performance
- Diagnosis: Promoted beyond current capability

**Recycling Process**:
1. **Manager admits fault**: "I misjudged your readiness for management."
2. **Open discussion**: "Let's talk about returning to a Sales Rep role with a path to future management."
3. **Support transition**: "We'll make this change openly. You were a great Sales Rep, and we value that."
4. **Maintain dignity**: "This is about finding the right fit, not punishment."
5. **Future path**: "In 12-18 months, we can reassess management readiness."

**Outcome**:
- Sarah returns to Sales Rep role
- Performance returns to "exceeds requirements"
- Embarrassment is short-lived
- After 18 months, Sarah is promoted to Sales Manager and succeeds

## Example 4: Failed Recycling (What Not to Do)

**Situation**: John was promoted from Developer to Tech Lead. Struggling after 6 months.

**Wrong Approach**:
- Manager: "This isn't working out. Maybe you should look for opportunities elsewhere."
- John: Feels forced out, leaves company
- Company loses a good developer
- John's confidence is damaged

**Correct Approach**:
- Manager: "I made a mistake promoting you too soon. Let's move you back to Developer. You were excellent there. Let's work on a development plan for future leadership."
- John: Stays, regains confidence, eventually succeeds in leadership role
