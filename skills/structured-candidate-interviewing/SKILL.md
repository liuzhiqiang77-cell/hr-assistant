# Structured Candidate Interviewing

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- Conducting an interview session with a job candidate
- Planning interview strategy and approach
- Checking references after initial interviews
- Performing post-interview analysis and decision-making

## Interview Questioning Techniques

### Ask Recommended Assessment Questions
Ask the following specific questions to evaluate the candidate:

**Projects and Recognition:**
- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."

**Self-Awareness:**
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"

**Value Proposition:**
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."

**Problem-Solving:**
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"

**Readiness:**
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"

**Achievements:**
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

### Categorize Inquiries
Ensure comprehensive coverage by categorizing questions:

- **Technical/Skills:** Projects, weaknesses, technical capability
- **What They Did With Knowledge:** Past achievements, past failures, application of learning
- **Discrepancies:** Learning from failures, problems in current position, prevention strategies
- **Operational Values:** Readiness for new job, why the company should hire them

### Use Direct Questions
Ask blunt, direct questions to elicit honest responses:
- Example: "How good are you technically?"
- Observe the candidate's reaction and confidence level
- Gauge actual capability through response confidence vs. timidity

### Employ Hypothetical Situations
Test problem-solving capacity in real-time:
- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps)
- Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result (e.g., finished cost of a wafer)
- Assess their ability to derive principles on the fly

### Invite Candidate Questions
Ask the candidate what they would like to know about:
- You as the interviewer
- The company
- The job

Analyze their questions to determine:
- What they already know about the role/company
- What they value in a position
- How prepared they are for the interview

## Reference Checking Protocol

### Build Rapport
Establish a personal connection with the reference:
- If you know the reference personally, leverage that relationship for candid information
- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

### Timing Strategy
The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond.

### Information Goal
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly, but from an external perspective.

## Strategic Principles

### Define Ultimate Purpose
Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance. Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit.

### Maintain Honesty
- Do not use "tricks" (e.g., three-legged chair) to test character
- Be completely straightforward
- Show yourself and the environment as they really are
- Rationale: A candidate is a potential employee. Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired.

### Conduct Follow-up Interviews
If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references. Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks.

## Limitations and Risk Acknowledgment

- Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- Accept that it merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well
- There is always a high risk of failure in hiring decisions
