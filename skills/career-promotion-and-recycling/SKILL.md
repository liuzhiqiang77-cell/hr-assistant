# Career Promotion and Recycling

## When to Use
- Employee performance rating is "exceeds requirements" and promotion is being considered
- Promoted employee performs below-average for extended period
- Organizing career development paths and managing talent pipelines
- Employee has been promoted "over their head"

## Promotion Performance Cycle

1. **Starting Point**: Employee at Job 1 performing "meets requirements" (average level)
2. **Improvement Phase**: With training and motivation, performance improves to "exceeds requirements" (above-average level)
3. **Promotion Trigger**: Once employee "exceeds requirements," they are considered "promotable" and are promoted to Job 2
4. **Performance Reset**: Upon entering Job 2, employee initially performs only at "meets requirements" level due to new challenges
5. **Cycle Repetition**: With experience in Job 2, employee improves to "exceeds requirements" → another promotion
6. **Cycle Conclusion**: Cycle repeats until employee settles at "meets requirements" level and is no longer promoted (reaching their "level of incompetence")

### Critical Constraint
If an employee "exceeds the requirements" but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will **atrophy** and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements."

## Employee Recycling Procedure

When an employee has been promoted "so much over their head" that they perform below-average for an extended time:

### Steps
1. **Identification**: Recognize that a person has been promoted beyond their capability
2. **Solution Selection**: Choose to "recycle" the employee rather than terminate them
3. **Definition**: Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion
4. **Management Accountability**: Management must admit it was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness"
5. **Implementation**: Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do
6. **Support System**: Support the employee in the face of likely embarrassment
7. **Transparency**: Execute the recycling "openly" to reduce stigma
8. **Expected Outcome**: The embarrassment will be "short-lived" and the employee will regain confidence
9. **Future Value**: Once confidence is regained, employee becomes an "excellent candidate for another promotion" at a later time and is likely to succeed

### Prohibited Action
Do NOT force the employee to leave the company. Reject the rationalization that "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake."

### Key Challenges
- Overcoming societal stigma regarding demotion
- Management tendency to view recycling as personal failure
- Requires forthright, deliberate action
