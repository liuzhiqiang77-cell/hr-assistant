# Employee Performance and Promotion Management

## When to Use This Skill
- An employee is not performing their job duties
- Diagnosing the root cause of underperformance
- Making promotion or hiring decisions
- Designing selection criteria for new roles
- Addressing performance management system issues
- Planning organizational succession

## Framework 1: Employee Performance Diagnosis

### Trigger Condition:
An employee is not performing their job duties as expected.

### Step 1: Identify Performance Issue

Confirm that:
- Role and expectations are clearly defined
- Performance standards have been communicated
- The employee has received feedback about the issue
- Sufficient time and resources have been provided

### Step 2: Determine Root Cause

Categorize the issue into one of two buckets:

| Category | Description | Question to Ask |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Can't do it** | Employee lacks capability, skill, or knowledge | "Does the employee know HOW to do the job?" |
| **Won't do it** | Employee lacks motivation, attitude, or willingness | "Does the employee WANT to do the job?" |

### Step 3: Select Intervention

**If Can't do (Capability Issue):**
- **Train the employee**
- Provide skill development opportunities
- Offer mentoring or coaching
- Ensure resources and tools are adequate
- Consider job redesign if skills gap is fundamental

**If Won't do (Motivation Issue):**
- **Motivate the employee**
- Clarify consequences and rewards
- Address underlying issues (burnout, personal problems, misalignment)
- Consider role change if motivation cannot be restored

### Step 4: Monitor and Adjust

**After Intervention:**
- Set clear improvement timeline
- Provide regular feedback
- Measure progress objectively
- Be prepared to escalate if improvement doesn't occur

**Critical Constraint:**
There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train. If neither works, the employee may not be suitable for the role.

## Framework 2: The Peter Principle

### Trigger Condition:
An organization selects a candidate for a position based on performance in their current role.

### Core Concept:

"In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to their level of incompetence."

### Step 1: Analyze Selection Criteria

**Common Problem:**
- Selection is based on the candidate's performance in their **current role**
- Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"

**Example:**
- Promoting top salesperson to sales manager
- Promoting best engineer to engineering manager
- Promoting star teacher to principal

### Step 2: Identify Missing Criteria

**Required Analysis:**
- What skills are required for the **new role**?
- How do these differ from skills in the **current role**?
- Does the candidate demonstrate the new skills?

**Skill Mismatch Examples:**

| Current Role Skills | New Role Skills | Mismatch Risk |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Individual execution | Team management | High |
| Technical expertise | Strategic thinking | High |
| Task completion | People development | High |
| Personal productivity | Organizational alignment | High |

### Step 3: Project the Trajectory

**Promotion Pattern:**
1. Employee succeeds in current role
2. Employee is promoted based on current success
3. Employee continues to be promoted until reaching a role they are not skilled for
4. Employee stops being promoted once no longer competent
5. Employee remains in role at "level of incompetence"

### Step 4: Define the Outcome

**Peter Principle State:**
- "Managers rise to the level of their incompetence"
- Organization filled with people in roles they can't perform
- Competent individual contributors are promoted away from what they do best
- Incompetent managers block promotion of capable subordinates

## Prevention Strategies

### Strategy 1: Competency-Based Selection

**Action:** Base promotion decisions on abilities related to the **intended role**, not current role performance.

**Implementation:**
- Define competencies required for each role
- Assess candidates against new role competencies
- Use assessment centers, simulations, or trial periods
- Gather 360-degree feedback on relevant skills

### Strategy 2: Dual Career Tracks

**Action:** Create separate advancement paths for individual contributors and managers.

**Implementation:**
- Technical track: Senior Engineer → Principal Engineer → Fellow
- Management track: Engineer → Manager → Director
- Equal compensation and status for both tracks
- Allow lateral movement between tracks with proper assessment

### Strategy 3: Managerial Training Before Promotion

**Action:** Provide management training and assessment before promoting to managerial roles.

**Implementation:**
- Identify high-potential employees early
- Provide leadership development programs
- Use acting or interim manager assignments
- Assess managerial capability before permanent promotion

### Strategy 4: Demotion and Role Adjustment

**Action:** Allow movement back to previous roles when promotion doesn't work out.

**Implementation:**
- Remove stigma from demotion
- Frame as "finding the right fit"
- Maintain compensation where possible
- Support employee's transition

## Decision Integration

### When Both Frameworks Apply:

**Scenario:** Promoted employee is underperforming in new managerial role.

1. **Apply Performance Diagnosis:**
   - Is this a "can't do" or "won't do" issue?
   - If "can't do": Provide managerial training
   - If "won't do": Address motivation or consider role change

2. **Apply Peter Principle Analysis:**
   - Was promotion based on current role performance?
   - Does employee lack new role competencies?
   - Should employee return to previous role?

## Decision Checklist

### Performance Diagnosis:
- [ ] Are role expectations clearly defined?
- [ ] Have you determined if it's "can't do" or "won't do"?
- [ ] Have you selected the appropriate intervention?
- [ ] Have you set a timeline for improvement?
- [ ] Are you monitoring progress objectively?

### Promotion Decisions:
- [ ] Are you assessing against new role competencies?
- [ ] Have you identified skill mismatches?
- [ ] Have you considered dual career tracks?
- [ ] Has the candidate demonstrated managerial capability?
- [ ] Is there a plan for development if promoted?

### Peter Principle Prevention:
- [ ] Do you have competency definitions for all roles?
- [ ] Do you use assessment tools for promotion decisions?
- [ ] Do you have dual career tracks?
- [ ] Can employees move back to previous roles without stigma?
- [ ] Do you provide management training before promotion?
