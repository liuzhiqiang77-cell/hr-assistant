# Employee Performance Diagnosis Examples

## Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: "Can't Do" - Skill Gap

**Situation:**
- Employee: Software developer
- Issue: Not completing tasks on time, code has many bugs
- Tenure: 3 months in role

**Diagnosis Process:**
1. **Observation:** Tasks are taking 2x longer than estimated
2. **Question:** "Do you know how to complete these tasks?"
3. **Answer:** "I'm not familiar with the framework we're using"
4. **Root Cause:** Can't do - lacks specific technical skill

**Intervention:**
- Provide formal training on the framework
- Pair with senior developer for mentorship
- Allocate time for learning and practice
- Reduce workload temporarily during training

1. **Observation:** Call volume is 50% of target
2. **Question:** "Do you know how to make these calls effectively?"
3. **Answer:** "Yes, I've done it successfully for years"
4. **Follow-up:** "What's preventing you from making the calls?"
5. **Answer:** "I don't see the point - commissions were cut and I'm burned out"
6. **Root Cause:** Won't do - lacks motivation due to compensation change and burnout

**Intervention:**

3. **Answer:** "I'm not sure about the tools and techniques"
4. **Question:** "Are you motivated to learn and improve?"
5. **Answer:** "Honestly, I miss doing the actual work. Managing people isn't what I expected"

## Diagnostic Questions Guide

### Determining "Can't Do":

- "What specific skills or knowledge do you need to perform this task?"
- "Have you received training on how to do this?"
- "What resources or tools would help you succeed?"
- "Can you walk me through how you would approach this task?"
- "What part of this task do you find most challenging?"

### Determining "Won't Do":

- "What's preventing you from completing this task?"
- "How do you feel about the importance of this work?"
- "What would motivate you to perform at a higher level?"
- "Are there personal or professional issues affecting your work?"
- "What changes would make this role more engaging for you?"

### Red Flags for Misdiagnosis:

**Assuming "Can't Do" when it's "Won't Do":
- Employee has the skills but isn't using them
- Training doesn't improve performance
- Employee performs well in areas they enjoy

**Assuming "Won't Do" when it's "Can't Do":
- Employee is trying hard but not succeeding
- Motivation seems high but results are low
