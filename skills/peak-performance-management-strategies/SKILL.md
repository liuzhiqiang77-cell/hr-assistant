# Peak Performance Management Strategies

## Strategy 1: Self-Actualization and MBO

### Understand the Driver Types

**Competence-Driven:**
- Focus: Job or task mastery
- Behavior: Sharpening own skill, trying to do better than before
- Examples: Violinist practicing daily, teenager perfecting skateboard trick

**Achievement-Driven:**
- Focus: Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors
- Behavior: Testing limits of capability, working at "boundary of capability"

### Implementation via MBO (Management by Objectives)

**Goal Setting Rule:**
- Set objectives at difficulty level where individual has only ~50% chance of success, even when pushing hard
- Rationale: Output is greater when striving for level beyond immediate grasp
- Accept that failure occurs ~50% of the time

**Cultural Environment Requirements:**
- Create "output-centered" culture:
  - Tangible results are highly valued and esteemed
  - Abstract knowledge without application gets little recognition
- Avoid "knowledge-centered" culture:
  - Knowing abstractly is valued over producing results
  - Leads to low actual achievement

## Strategy 2: Competitive Sports Management Approach

### Step 1: Establish the Arena of Competition

- Create clear "rules of the game" for the work environment
- Implement specific metrics/scores allowing employees to measure against peers
- Example: Assign "building czar" to score facility maintenance across buildings
- Competition creates immediate improvement without monetary rewards

### Step 2: Define Manager's Role as Coach

- Take NO personal credit for team's success (builds trust)
- Be tough and critical to push to "personal best"
- Steer employees away from irrelevant rewards (office size) toward task-relevant feedback (performance reviews)

### Step 3: Manage Fear and Failure

**Shift in Fear:**
- From: "Loss of job"
- To: "Fear of failure"

**Positive vs Negative Fear:**
- **Positive:** Fear of failure spurs performance
- **Negative:** Fear becomes preoccupation causing conservative risk-avoidance

**Normalize Failure:**
- Adopt sports mindset: losing is statistical probability (e.g., 50% of matches)
- Failure is NOT a reason to quit

### Step 4: Maintain Competitive Environment

- Monitor for removal of competition (e.g., mergers) → causes motivation to vanish
- Ensure "game" remains active for self-sustaining motivation

## When to Use Each Strategy

**Use Self-Actualization/MBO when:**
- Employees are intrinsically motivated by growth
- Tasks require creativity and stretch
- Work is not routine

**Use Competitive Sports Approach when:**
- Team culture accepts direct feedback and comparison
- Performance is measurable and comparable
- Work can be structured as "games" with clear scoring
- Employees respond well to challenge and competition
