# Managerial Training Design

Design high-leverage, manager-led training programs that align with organizational culture and needs.

## When to Use
- Planning training programs for your organization
- Calculating training resource needs and budget
- Deciding what training to provide and to whom
- Assessing the ROI of training investments

## Part 1: Assign the Trainer Role

**The manager must instruct direct subordinates and the next few ranks below.**

**Rationale:**
- Training must be performed by a "suitable role model"
- Trainer must be a "believable, practicing authority"
- Proxies, regardless of subject matter expertise, cannot fill this role effectively

## Part 2: High-Leverage Training ROI

### Calculate Training Impact

**Example Calculation:**
- Preparation: 3 hours per 1 hour of course time
- Conduct 4 lectures (Total Manager Time = 12 hours)
- Train 10 students
- Students will work ~20,000 hours total next year
- If training yields 1% improvement: **200 hours gained** for 12-hour investment

**Key Variables:**
- `prep_ratio`: Hours of preparation per hour of course time (standard: 3)
- `total_student_hours`: Total annual work hours of trained group
- `performance_improvement`: Efficiency gain from training (e.g., 1%)

## Part 3: Training Volume Calculation

### Task 1: New Member Training
Teaching new members the skills needed to perform their jobs.

**Formula:**
```
Annual Training Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)
```

**Example:** Department with 10% turnover and 10% growth = 20% annual training load

### Task 2: New Skill Training
Teaching new ideas, principles, or skills to present members.

**Target:** 100% of the staff

**Comparison Formula:**
```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

**Example:** If Task 1 is 20%, Task 2 is **5 times larger** (100% / 20%)

### Cost Evaluation
- Calculate cost based on student time
- **Benchmark:** A one-day course for middle-management staff can cost over $1,000,000 in student time alone
- **Decision Rule:** Do not enter Task 2 (training all staff) lightly due to high magnitude and cost

## Part 4: Curriculum and Cultural Alignment

### Establish Curriculum Scope
- Maintain a catalogue of courses (e.g., 50+ classes)
- Cover range from basic skills (telephone manners) to complex technical skills (ion implanter operation ~200 hours)
- Include management disciplines (strategic planning, "constructive confrontation", performance reviews, productive meetings)
- Allocate approximately 2% to 4% of employee time to classroom learning

### Ensure Cultural Alignment
- Avoid "highly structured and academic" approaches if they contradict company practices
- Example: If tradition is "free market" where employees apply for jobs on own initiative, do not teach "carefully coordinated job rotations"
- **Warning:** Mismatch between teaching and practice demoralizes participants

### Maintain Consistency
- Training must be a **process, not an event**
- Provide a "reliable, consistent presence" that is "systematic and scheduled"
- Do not use training as a "rescue effort" summoned to solve the problem of the moment

## Mitigate Risks of Insufficient Training
Failure to train employees to recognize specific conditions leads to:
- Inefficiencies
- Excess costs
- Unhappy customers
- Danger (e.g., untrained operator causing >$1M in scrapped material)

## Constraints
- Training content must align with company culture
- Training must not be a one-time "rescue effort"
- Proxies cannot assume the role of teacher
