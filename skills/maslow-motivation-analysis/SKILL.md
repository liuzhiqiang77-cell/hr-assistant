# Maslow Motivation Analysis

## When to Use
- Analyzing what drives an individual's or team's behavior
- Diagnosing motivation problems or performance issues
- Interpreting employee reactions to compensation changes
- Understanding why certain incentives work or fail

## Core Principles

### The Motivation Chain
Needs → Drives → Motivation

### Key Rules
1. **Satiation Rule**: A satisfied need stops being a motivation source
2. **Dominance Principle**: One need is always stronger than others and determines behavior
3. **Maintenance Rule**: Keep some needs unsatisfied to maintain motivation
4. **Hierarchical Progression**: Lower needs must be satisfied before higher needs dominate

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify the Dominant Need
Observe behavior and classify the primary driver:

1. **Physiological Needs**: Focus on basic necessities, fear of deprivation
2. **Safety/Security Needs**: Focus on protection against loss, maintaining standard of living
3. **Social/Affiliation Needs**: Focus on belonging, team identity, companionship
4. **Esteem/Recognition Needs**: Focus on status, recognition from reference group
5. **Self-Actualization**: Focus on achieving personal best, testing limits

### Step 2: Apply the Money Motivation Test
When analyzing reactions to compensation changes:

1. Observe the employee's reaction to a raise or bonus
2. Determine focus:
   - **Absolute Sum**: Focus on the amount received → Physiological/Safety needs
   - **Relative Comparison**: Focus on how it compares to others → Esteem/Self-Actualization
3. Interpret:
   - Lower levels: Money is a utilitarian resource (motivation ceases when target met)
   - Upper levels: Money is a scorecard for achievement (motivation is boundless)

### Step 3: Predict Behavior Changes
- If environment changes drastically (crisis, restructuring), expect regression to lower needs
- If current dominant need is satisfied, expect shift to next higher need
- Motivation will drop if all needs are satisfied

## Output
Classification of the individual's primary motivation level and prediction of what incentives will be effective.
