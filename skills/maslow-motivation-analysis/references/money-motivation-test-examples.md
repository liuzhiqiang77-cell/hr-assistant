# Money Motivation Test - Detailed Examples

## Scenario A: Absolute Sum Focus (Physiological/Safety)

### Example 1: Caribbean Plant Workers
- **Situation:** Workers offered bonus for reaching production target
- **Behavior:** Workers focused only on total amount needed to buy specific items (radio, bicycle)
- **Outcome:** Once target reached, workers quit - motivation extinguished
- **Diagnosis:** Physiological/Safety needs dominant

### Example 2: Entry-Level Employee
- **Situation:** Receives $5,000 raise
- **Reaction:** "Great, now I can afford that car payment/rent increase"
- **Focus:** What the money can buy (utilitarian view)
- **Management:** Motivation tied to specific financial goals

## Scenario B: Relative Comparison Focus (Esteem/Self-Actualization)

### Example 1: Venture Capitalists
- **Situation:** VC earns $10 million on investment
- **Reaction:** "How did this compare to other VCs? Was this a top-dealile return?"
- **Focus:** Ranking and achievement measure, not purchasing power
- **Characteristic:** "The second ten million is just as important as the first"
- **Diagnosis:** Esteem/Self-Actualization needs dominant

### Example 2: Senior Executive
- **Situation:** Receives compensation package
- **Reaction:** "Is this at market rate for my level? How does it compare to peers?"
- **Focus:** Status and recognition through compensation
- **Management:** Compensation as scorecard, not resource

## Diagnostic Questions

When analyzing compensation reactions, ask:

1. **What does the employee talk about first?**
   - "I can buy X" → Lower levels
   - "This puts me at Y percentile" → Upper levels

2. **How do they frame the value?**
   - Purchasing power/utilitarian → Lower levels
   - Achievement/status symbol → Upper levels

3. **What happens after the goal is met?**
   - Motivation drops → Lower levels (deficit need)
   - Motivation continues → Upper levels (growth need)

## Management Implications by Level

### For Lower-Level Motivated Employees:
- Clear financial targets work well
- Bonuses tied to specific monetary goals
- Motivation predictable and bounded
- Risk of quitting once goals achieved

### For Upper-Level Motivated Employees:
- Relative positioning matters more than absolute amount
- Compensation as recognition of achievement
- Motivation self-sustaining and boundless
- Use compensation as scorecard for success
