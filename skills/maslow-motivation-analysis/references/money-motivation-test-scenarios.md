# Money Motivation Test - Detailed Scenarios

## Scenario A: Absolute Sum Focus

**Behavior**: Employee focuses on the absolute amount of money received.

**Interpretation**: Motivated by Physiological or Safety needs.

**Reasoning**:
- Money is viewed as utilitarian resource
- Used to buy necessities or reach predetermined standard of living
- Once target is met, motivation ceases

**Real-World Example**:
Caribbean plant workers who quit after reaching a specific savings goal. The money served a deficit need, and once satisfied, no longer motivated.

**Management Implications**:
- Monetary incentives work but have ceiling effect
- Once need satisfied, must appeal to higher needs
- Clear financial targets can be effective motivators

## Scenario B: Relative Comparison Focus

**Behavior**: Employee focuses on how their raise compares to others received.

**Interpretation**: Motivated by Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization.

**Reasoning**:
- Money is viewed as "measure of achievement"
- Relative ranking matters more than absolute amount
- Motivation is boundless

**Real-World Example**:
Venture Capitalists who continue working aggressively after earning millions. The "second ten million" is just as important as the first because it signifies achievement.

**Management Implications**:
- Monetary incentives alone may not be sufficient
- Recognition and status become important
- Achievement-focused culture needed
- Money as scorecard, not just resource

## Diagnostic Questions

When applying this test, ask:

1. Does the employee compare their compensation to peers?
2. Is the employee satisfied once reaching a specific financial target?
3. Does the employee view money as means to an end or end in itself?
4. How does the employee react when others receive larger raises?

## Edge Cases

**Cultural Differences**: Standard of living expectations vary by culture, affecting what constitutes "expected level" for physiological/safety needs.

**Life Stage**: Younger employees may be more deficit-need focused, while established professionals may be achievement-focused.

**Industry Norms**: Some industries (e.g., finance) may normalize relative comparison focus.
