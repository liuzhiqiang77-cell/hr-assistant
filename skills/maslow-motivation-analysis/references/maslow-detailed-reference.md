# Maslow's Hierarchy - Detailed Reference

## Need Level Definitions

### Physiological Needs
- **Definition**: Basic necessities of life that money can buy
- **Driver**: Fear of deprivation (starvation, homelessness)
- **Example**: Dickens-era workers laboring to avoid starvation
- **Ceiling**: Motivation stops once basic standard is met

### Security/Safety Needs
- **Definition**: Desire to protect oneself from slipping back to deprivation
- **Driver**: Protection against catastrophic loss
- **Example**: Medical insurance to prevent bankruptcy from hospital fees
- **Note**: Rarely dominant but absence badly affects performance

### Social/Affiliation Needs
- **Definition**: Inherent desire to belong to a group with common traits
- **Driver**: Companionship and team identity
- **Example**: Taking low-paying job for colleague companionship
- **Pattern**: "Misery loves not just any company, but the company of other miserable people"

### Esteem/Recognition Needs
- **Definition**: Desire to keep up with or emulate a specific person or group
- **Driver**: Recognition from a specific reference group
- **Example**: "Keeping up with the Joneses"
- **Limitation**: Self-limiting; once goal reached, need loses urgency
- **Note**: Esteem exists in the eyes of the beholder (athlete greeting top player means nothing to family)

### Self-Actualization
- **Definition**: Need to achieve one's "utter personal best"
- **Driver**: Testing limits of capability
- **Characteristic**: Does not extinguish after fulfillment; drives to ever higher levels

## Money Motivation Test Examples

### Lower-Level Motivation (Physiological/Safety)
- **Scenario**: Caribbean plant workers
- **Behavior**: Quit after reaching specific monetary goal
- **Interpretation**: Money satisfies deficit need

### Upper-Level Motivation (Esteem/Self-Actualization)
- **Scenario**: Venture Capitalists
- **Behavior**: "Second ten million is just as important as the first"
- **Interpretation**: Money is scorecard for achievement

## Edge Cases

### Regressive Movement
When environment changes drastically (earthquake, economic crisis, war), individuals can instantly regress from satisfying high-level needs to fundamental survival needs.

### Concurrent Needs
People always have multiple needs active simultaneously. The key is identifying which is DOMINANT, not which is present.
