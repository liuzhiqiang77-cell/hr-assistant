# Maslow's Hierarchy Dynamics - Detailed Reference

## The Chain of Causality

```
Needs → Drives → Motivation → Behavior
```

## The Satiation Rule

**Principle**: A need once satisfied stops being a need and therefore stops being a source of motivation.

**Implications**:
- You cannot motivate someone by satisfying a need that is already met
- Offering more food to someone who is well-fed will not motivate them

## The Maintenance Requirement

**Principle**: To create and maintain a high degree of motivation, you must keep some needs unsatisfied at all times.

**Paradox**: Complete satisfaction of all needs leads to zero motivation.

## The Dominance Principle

**Principle**: 
- People tend to have a variety of concurrent needs
- One need is always stronger than the others
- This dominant need largely determines the individual's motivation and performance level

## Hierarchical Progression

**Standard Pattern**:
```
Physiological → Safety → Social → Esteem → Self-Actualization
```

**Rule**: When a lower need is satisfied, a higher need is likely to take over as the dominant need.

## Regressive Movement (Edge Case)

**Principle**: If the environment or condition changes drastically, individuals can regress from satisfying high-level needs to satisfying fundamental needs instantly.

**Triggers**:
- Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods)
- Economic crises (layoffs, market crashes)
- Personal crises (illness, divorce)

**Example**: A self-actualizing architect may suddenly focus entirely on job security during an economic downturn.
