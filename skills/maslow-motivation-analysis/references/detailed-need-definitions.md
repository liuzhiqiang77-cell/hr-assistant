# Detailed Maslow Level Definitions

## Physiological Needs
**Definition**: Basic necessities of life (food, clothing) that money can buy
**Driver**: Fear of deprivation (e.g., fear of starvation)
**Example**: Victorian-era workers working to avoid starvation; Caribbean plant workers quitting after reaching a specific savings goal

## Security/Safety Needs
**Definition**: Desire to protect oneself from slipping back to deprivation
**Driver**: Protection against catastrophic loss
**Example**: Medical insurance protecting against bankruptcy from hospital fees
**Note**: Rarely dominant, but absence badly affects performance

## Social/Affiliation Needs
**Definition**: Inherent desire to belong to a group with common traits
**Driver**: Companionship and team identity
**Example**: Taking a low-paying job solely for the companionship of colleagues; "misery loves not just any company, but the company of other miserable people"

## Esteem/Recognition Needs
**Definition**: Desire to keep up with or emulate a specific person or group ("keeping up with the Joneses")
**Driver**: Recognition from a specific reference group
**Note**: 
- Esteem exists in the eyes of the beholder (e.g., an athlete greeting a top player feels great to the athlete, but means nothing to family)
- Self-limiting: Once a goal is reached (e.g., becoming VP), the need loses urgency and stops motivating

## Self-Actualization Needs
**Definition**: Need to achieve one's "utter personal best" in a chosen field
**Key Characteristic**: Unlike other motivation sources, it does NOT extinguish after needs are fulfilled; it drives performance to ever higher levels
**Driver Types**:
- Competence-Driven: Job mastery, sharpening skills (e.g., violinist practicing daily)
- Achievement-Driven: Testing limits of capability in all endeavors (e.g., "working at the boundary of their capability")

# Edge Cases and Special Situations

## Regressive Movement
If the environment or condition changes drastically (e.g., earthquake, economic crisis), individuals can regress from satisfying high-level needs to satisfying fundamental needs (survival/physiological) instantly.

## Knowledge-Centered vs Output-Centered Culture
- **Knowledge-centered**: Knowing abstractly is valued over producing results → leads to low actual achievement
- **Output-centered**: Tangible results are highly valued and esteemed → fosters self-actualization and peak performance

## MBO Goal Setting for Self-Actualization
Set objectives at a difficulty level where the individual has only a "fifty-fifty chance" of making them, even if they push hard. Rationale: Output tends to be greater when striving for a level beyond immediate grasp, even if failure occurs half the time.
