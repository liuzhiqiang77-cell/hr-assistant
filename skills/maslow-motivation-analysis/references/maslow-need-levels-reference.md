# Maslow's Need Levels - Detailed Reference

## Physiological Needs

**Definition**: Basic necessities of life (food, clothing, shelter) that money can buy.

**Driver**: Fear of deprivation (e.g., fear of starvation).

**Example**: A worker in Dickens' era working solely to avoid starvation.

**Characteristics**:
- Most fundamental level
- Once satisfied, ceases to motivate
- Money is viewed as utilitarian resource

## Safety/Security Needs

**Definition**: Desire to protect oneself from slipping back to deprivation.

**Driver**: Protection against catastrophic loss.

**Example**: Medical insurance protecting against bankruptcy from hospital fees.

**Characteristics**:
- Rarely dominant, but absence badly affects performance
- Focus on stability and predictability
- Money is viewed as security buffer

## Social/Affiliation Needs

**Definition**: Inherent desire to belong to a group with common traits.

**Driver**: Companionship and team identity.

**Examples**:
- Taking a low-paying job solely for the companionship of colleagues
- "Misery loves not just any company, but the company of other miserable people"
- Excited people wanting to be with other excited people

**Characteristics**:
- People seek similarity in emotional states
- Team identity is powerful motivator
- Recognition from the group matters

## Esteem/Recognition Needs

**Definition**: Desire to keep up with or emulate a specific person or group ("keeping up with the Joneses").

**Driver**: Recognition from a specific reference group.

**Characteristics**:
- Esteem exists in the eyes of the beholder
- Example: An athlete greeting a top player feels great to the athlete, but means nothing to family
- Self-limiting: Once a goal is reached (e.g., becoming VP), the need loses urgency
- Money becomes a scorecard for achievement

## Self-Actualization

**Definition**: Need to achieve one's "utter personal best" in a chosen field.

**Driver**: Inner drive for excellence and growth.

**Characteristics**:
- Does not extinguish after fulfillment
- Drives performance to ever higher levels
- Two sub-types:
  - **Competence-Driven**: Focus on job/task mastery (e.g., violinist practicing daily)
  - **Achievement-Driven**: Focus on testing limits of capability across endeavors
- Money is purely a measure of achievement, boundless motivation

## Edge Cases

### Regressive Movement

If the environment or condition changes drastically (e.g., earthquake, crisis), individuals can regress from satisfying high-level needs to satisfying fundamental needs (survival/physiological) instantly.

### Concurrent Needs

People always have multiple concurrent needs, but one dominates at any given time. The dominant need determines current motivation and behavior.
