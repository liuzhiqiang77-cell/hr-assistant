# Employee Performance Management

## When to Use
- An employee is not performing their job duties
- Making promotion decisions
- Designing selection criteria for new roles
- Addressing underperformance in your team

## Diagnose Performance Issues

### The Performance Diagnosis Framework
When an employee is not doing their job, determine the root cause:

**1. Can't Do It (Capability Issue)**
- Employee lacks the knowledge, skills, or ability
- **Solution**: Train the employee

**2. Won't Do It (Motivation Issue)**
- Employee has the ability but lacks drive or willingness
- **Solution**: Motivate the employee

### Critical Constraint
There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train.

## Avoid the Peter Principle

### Understanding the Peter Principle
Managers rise to the level of their incompetence when:
1. Selection of a candidate for a position is based on performance in their current role
2. Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"
3. The employee continues to be promoted until they reach a role they are not skilled for
4. Promotion stops once they are no longer competent

### Prevent Peter Principle in Promotion Decisions

**Do NOT base selection solely on:**
- Current role performance
- Past success in existing position

**Base selection ON:**
- Abilities specific to the intended role
- Competencies required for the new position
- Assessment of skills needed for future responsibilities

### When Peter Principle Does NOT Apply
- Selection is based on competencies specific to the intended role
- Skills required for the new role are identical to the current role
- No hierarchical promotion structure exists

## Application Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Underperformance
Observe that the employee is not meeting job expectations or requirements.

### Step 2: Diagnose Root Cause
Ask: Is this a "can't" or "won't" issue?
- Can't = Training gap
- Won't = Motivation gap

### Step 3: Apply Appropriate Intervention
- If Can't: Design and deliver targeted training
- If Won't: Apply motivational techniques and incentives

### Step 4: For Promotion Decisions
Evaluate candidates based on:
1. Required competencies for the new role
2. Demonstrated abilities relevant to future responsibilities
3. NOT solely on current role performance

## Key Principles
- Role and expectations must be clearly defined before diagnosis
- Training addresses capability gaps
- Motivation addresses willingness gaps
- Promotion criteria must align with future role requirements
- Current performance is an indicator, not the sole predictor
