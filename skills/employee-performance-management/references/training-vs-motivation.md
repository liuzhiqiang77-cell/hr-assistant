# Training vs Motivation: Detailed Guidance

## Training Interventions (Can't Do It)

### When to Use Training
- Employee is new to the role or industry
- Technology or processes have changed
- Employee lacks specific technical skills
- Performance gaps are consistent across all tasks
- Employee shows effort but results don't match

### Effective Training Approaches
- **On-the-job training**: Pair with experienced performer
- **Formal coursework**: External or internal classes
- **Mentoring**: Long-term guidance relationship
- **Job rotation**: Exposure to different aspects of the work
- **Documentation**: Create SOPs, checklists, knowledge bases

### Measuring Training Effectiveness
- Pre- and post-training assessment
- Observation of applied skills on the job
- Performance metrics improvement over time
- Employee confidence and self-assessment

## Motivation Interventions (Won't Do It)

### When to Use Motivation
- Employee has demonstrated capability in the past
- Performance is inconsistent (good some days, poor others)
- Employee excels in tasks they enjoy but neglects others
- Performance correlates with consequences or incentives
- Employee expresses dissatisfaction or disengagement

### Effective Motivation Approaches
- **Goal setting**: Clear, challenging, achievable targets
- **Recognition**: Public acknowledgment of good work
- **Incentives**: Bonuses, raises, promotions tied to performance
- **Consequences**: Performance improvement plans, disciplinary action
- **Job crafting**: Align work with employee interests
- **Autonomy**: Give more control over how work is done

### Diagnosing Motivation Issues
Ask the employee:
- "What would make this work more engaging for you?"
- "What obstacles are preventing you from performing at your best?"
- "What do you find most satisfying about your work?"
- "What would need to change for you to be more motivated?"

## When Neither Works

If both training and motivation interventions fail:
1. Reassess role fit (is this the right role for this person?)
2. Consider lateral move to different role
3. Begin performance improvement plan with clear consequences
4. Prepare for separation if improvement doesn't occur

## Common Mistakes

### Mistreating Motivation as Training
- Sending a disengaged employee to training won't help
- Wastes resources and frustrates the employee

### Mistreating Training as Motivation
- Offering rewards to someone who lacks capability won't help
- Creates frustration for both employee and manager

### Not Diagnosing First
- Jumping to solutions without understanding root cause
- Applying wrong intervention makes problem worse

### One-Size-Fits-All Approach
- Different employees need different approaches
- Same employee may need different approaches at different times
