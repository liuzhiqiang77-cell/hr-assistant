## Peter Principle Examples

### Classic Scenario
- Excellent individual contributor promoted to team lead
- Team lead promoted to manager
- Manager promoted to director despite no strategic aptitude
- Now stuck as ineffective director

### Prevention Scenario
- Evaluate individual contributor for management role based on leadership potential, not coding skills
- Assess team lead for manager role based on people management abilities, not project delivery
- Require strategic thinking assessments for director-level promotions
