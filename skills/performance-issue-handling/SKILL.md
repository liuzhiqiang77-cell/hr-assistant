description: Handle major performance problems requiring turnaround using the 'Blast' process, or develop high achievers with future-focused improvement strategies. Use when a subordinate has a major performance problem (risk of termination) or is a high achiever needing development.

# Performance Issue Handling

## When to Use

**For 'Blast' Process**:
- Subordinate has major performance problem
- Turnaround required to avoid termination
- Subordinate is in denial or blaming others
- Performance must improve urgently

**For High Achiever Development**:
- Subordinate is identified as high performer
- Review is focused on justifying past performance
- Need to leverage high achiever for greater impact
- Want to move beyond retrospective assessment

## Approach 1: The 'Blast' Process (Major Performance Problems)

### Resistance Cycle Stages

1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem but blames others
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy situation

### Facilitation Process

**Stage 1-3 (Ignore → Deny → Blame Others)**:
- Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
- Present evidence to overcome resistance
- Do not accept excuses or deflection

**Stage 4 (Assume Responsibility)**:
- Guide subordinate to take ownership
- This is the critical emotional step
- Realization: "If it's my problem, I must do something about it"
- Implies work and unpleasantness ahead

**Stage 5 (Find Solution)**:
- Once responsibility assumed, solution-finding is shared task
- Relatively easier (intellectual vs emotional)
- Collaborative problem-solving

### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')

When subordinate refuses to assume responsibility:

1. **Assume formal supervisor role**: Exercise position power
2. **State instruction clearly**: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do"
3. **Acknowledge disagreement**: "I understand you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right"
4. **Assert organizational requirement**: "I am empowered and required by the organization to give you instructions"
5. **Secure commitment**: Obtain agreement to follow the course of action
6. **Monitor performance**: Track against the commitment

### Possible Outcomes

- **Outcome 1**: Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
- **Outcome 2**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
- **Outcome 3**: Subordinate disagrees and does not commit → Use fallback procedure

## Approach 2: High Achiever Development Strategy

### The Problem

Supervisors often:
- Spend effort justifying superior performance rating
- Give little attention to how subordinate could do even better
- Provide retrospective assessment only

### The Contrast

**Poor performers** receive:
- Detailed corrective action programs
- Step-by-step plans to meet minimum requirements

**High achievers** often receive:
- Justification of high rating
- Little future-oriented guidance

### Development Strategy

1. **Analyze current review**: Is it retrospective or developmental?
2. **Identify the gap**: Lack of future-focused improvement steps
3. **Define specific actions**: What must subordinate do to improve or maintain performance?
4. **Leverage the opportunity**: High achievers account for disproportionate work output
5. **Maximize impact**: Improving high achievers is high-leverage activity

### Key Principle

**High-leverage activity**: Small investment in high achiever development yields large impact on group output.

## Key Constraints

- Blast process cannot proceed to solution-finding if subordinate is stuck in denial/blame
- High achiever strategy does not apply to poor performers needing corrective action
- Blast process requires facts and examples before initiation
- High achiever development requires identification of specific improvement actions

## Decision Summary

| Situation | Approach | Key Focus |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Major performance problem | Blast Process | Move through resistance cycle to responsibility |
| Stuck at blame | Fallback Procedure | Use position power to secure commitment |
| High achiever | Development Strategy | Future-focused improvement steps |
