# The 'Blast' Process: Detailed Implementation

## Preparing for the Blast Review

### Required Evidence

Before initiating the process, gather:
- Specific performance data and metrics
- Concrete examples of performance failures
- Documentation of previous feedback attempts
- Clear description of expected performance
- Timeline for improvement

### Setting the Stage

- Schedule dedicated meeting (not rushed)
- Ensure private setting
- Have written documentation prepared
- Plan for sufficient time (may require multiple sessions)

## Stage-by-Stage Facilitation Techniques

### Stage 1: Ignore → Stage 2: Deny

**Subordinate behavior**:
- "I don't know what you're talking about"
- "Everything is fine"
- Avoids discussion of performance

**Manager response**:
- Present specific data: "Your sales are 40% below target for 3 consecutive months"
- Show examples: "Here are three customer complaints about missed deadlines"
- Be direct and factual

### Stage 2: Deny → Stage 3: Blame Others

**Subordinate behavior**:
- "It's not my fault"
- "Marketing didn't give me good leads"
- "The economy is bad"
- "Other departments aren't supporting me"

**Manager response**:
- Acknowledge external factors but refocus on controllable elements
- "Even with those challenges, what could you have done differently?"
- "Other reps in the same territory are meeting targets"
- Keep bringing conversation back to their actions

### Stage 3: Blame Others → Stage 4: Assume Responsibility

**Subordinate behavior**:
- Deflecting, making excuses
- Refusing to own any part of the problem

**Manager response**:
- This is the most difficult transition
- Ask: "What portion of this result is within your control?"
- "If you were in my position, how would you view your performance?"
- Be patient but persistent
- Recognize this is an emotional breakthrough, not intellectual

### The Emotional Breakthrough

When subordinate says "It's my problem" or "I need to fix this":
- Acknowledge the statement
- Validate the difficulty of admitting this
- Shift immediately to solution-finding
- "Now that we agree on the problem, let's work on the solution"

## Fallback Procedure Script

**Manager**: "I understand you don't see it my way. You may be right or I may be right. But I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."

**Key elements**:
- Acknowledge disagreement (shows respect)
- Assert organizational authority (not personal)
- State instruction clearly
- Require commitment

## Post-Review Monitoring

- Schedule follow-up meetings
- Track specific metrics agreed upon
- Document progress
- Be prepared to escalate if no improvement

## Common Pitfalls

- **Moving to solution too early**: Subordinate hasn't truly accepted responsibility
- **Accepting partial responsibility**: "It's 50% my fault" is not enough
- **Losing patience**: The emotional breakthrough takes time
- **Being too harsh**: Goal is improvement, not punishment
- **Being too soft**: Must be clear about consequences of non-improvement
