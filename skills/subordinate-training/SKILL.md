# Subordinate Training Implementation

Managers can effectively train subordinates by starting small, iterating based on feedback, and embracing the learning benefits that come from teaching.

## When to Use
- Manager decides to implement a training program for subordinates
- First-time instructor preparing to teach or train others
- Subject matter experts need to transfer knowledge to team

## Prerequisites
- Manager desires to train subordinates
- Access to department members for needs assessment
- Possession of subject matter expertise

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Training Needs Assessment

1. **Create Training List**
   - List topics subordinates should be trained in
   - Do not limit scope—include simple tasks (e.g., taking calls) and broad concepts (e.g., objectives, value systems)
   - Ask subordinates what they feel they need to uncover unknown needs

2. **Resource Inventory and Prioritization**
   - Take inventory of available manager-teachers and instructional materials
   - Assign priorities to items on the training list

### Phase 2: Initial Course Design

1. **Start Unambitiously**
   - Begin with one short course (3-4 lectures) on the most urgent subject
   - Explaining skills you possess is harder than practicing them
   - Avoid excessive background information that obscures course objectives

2. **Preparation and Launch**
   - Set a schedule with deadlines to prevent getting bogged down
   - Create an outline for the whole course
   - Develop only the first lecture and begin teaching

### Phase 3: Iterative Development

1. **Lecture-by-Lecture Approach**
   - Develop the second lecture only after delivering the first
   - Regard the first delivery as a "throwaway"—accept it will be unsatisfactory

2. **Mitigate Initial Damage**
   - Teach the first version to knowledgeable subordinates
   - They can provide interaction and critique without confusion

### Phase 4: Scalability Assessment

Determine if you can:
- Teach all members personally
- Or if it requires many repetitions (e.g., ten or twenty courses)

**If organization is large:** Use the first set of lectures to train a few instructors (train-the-trainer model).

### Phase 5: Feedback and Evaluation

1. **Request Anonymous Critiques**
   - Use a form prompting for numerical ratings and open-ended questions
   - Expect mixed feedback (too detailed, too superficial, just right—in equal balance)
   - Aim to satisfy yourself that objectives are met, rather than trying to please everyone

## Teaching Realities and Rewards

### Acknowledge the Difficulty
- Teaching is "hard work" involving lecture preparation and handling unpredictable questions
- **Expect knowledge gaps:** Even with long-term experience, you'll realize "how much you don't know"
- **Key Principle:** "Much deeper knowledge of a task is required to teach that task than simply to do it"
- **Analogy:** Explaining to someone over the phone how to drive a stick-shift car

### Recognize Personal Learning Benefits
- **Primary Beneficiary:** The instructor ("Guess who will have learned most from the course? You.")
- **Outcome:** Course development provides "crispness" to your understanding of your own work
- **Value:** This improved understanding makes the effort "extremely worthwhile" in itself

### Leverage Emotional Rewards
- **Immediate Reward:** A successful training process is "nothing short of exhilarating"
- **Ultimate Reward:** Seeing a subordinate practice the taught material creates a "warm feeling" that "dwarfs" the exhilaration
- **Strategic Advice:** "Relish the exhilaration and warmth" to build resilience for "tackling the second course"

## Key Variables
- `training_list`: List of identified training topics ranging from simple to complex
- `course_length`: Recommended initial duration of 3-4 lectures
- `feedback_form`: Tool for collecting numerical ratings and open-ended comments
- `instructor_experience`: Length of time performing the job being taught
- `training_success`: Whether training process is perceived as going well

## Important Notes
- Do not be discouraged by discovering knowledge gaps—this is "typical"
- The first iteration of training will be unsatisfactory—accept this as part of the process
- Implementation difficulty: Medium
