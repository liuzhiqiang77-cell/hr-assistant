# Candidate Interviewing Methodology and Reference Checking

## When to Use This Skill
- Conducting an interview session with a job candidate
- Planning interview strategy and approach
- Checking references for a candidate
- Conducting follow-up interviews after reference checks
- Making hiring decisions based on comprehensive assessment

## Prerequisites
- Scheduled interview time
- Candidate resume and background information
- Completed initial interview (for reference checking phase)
- List of references (for reference checking phase)

## Constraints
- Limited time (typically an hour or two for interviews)
- Candidate may provide self-assessment that needs verification
- High risk of failure in hiring decisions
- No guarantee of success even with careful interviewing

## Part 1: Interview Questioning Techniques

### Ask Specific Recommended Questions
Use these questions to assess the candidate comprehensively:

- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

### Categorize Inquiries for Coverage
Ensure you cover all these categories:

**Technical/Skills:**
- Past projects and technical capabilities
- Acknowledged weaknesses and improvement efforts

**What They Did With Knowledge:**
- Past achievements and their significance
- Past failures and lessons learned

**Discrepancies:**
- Learning from failures
- Problems in current position and prevention strategies

**Operational Values:**
- Readiness for the new job
- Why the company should hire them

### Utilize Direct Questions
- Ask blunt questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?") to elicit direct answers
- Observe the candidate's reaction and the confidence/timidity of the response
- Gauge actual capability through response quality and demeanor

### Employ Hypothetical Situations
- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps)
- Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result (e.g., finished cost of a wafer)
- Assess problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly

### Invite Candidate Questions
- Ask the candidate what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job
- Analyze their questions to determine:
  - What they already know
  - What they value
  - How prepared they are

## Part 2: Strategic Principles

### Define the Ultimate Purpose
- Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance
- Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit

### Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks
- Do not use 'tricks' (e.g., three-legged chair) to test character
- Be completely straightforward; show yourself and the environment as they really are
- **Rationale:** A candidate is a potential employee. Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired.

## Part 3: Reference Checking Protocol

### Goal of Reference Checking
- Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly
- Verify and validate candidate responses

### Build Rapport
**If you know the reference personally:**
- You have a better chance of getting 'real' information
- Leverage existing relationship for openness

**If the reference is a stranger:**
- Keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness
- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond

### Timing Strategy
- Allocate sufficient time for reference calls (minimum 30 minutes)
- Plan for rapport-building phase before asking critical questions

---

## Part 4: Follow-up and Limitations

### Conduct Follow-up Interviews
- If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks
- Clarify any discrepancies or concerns raised during reference checks

### Acknowledge Limitations
- Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- Accept that it merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well
- Maintain realistic expectations about hiring outcomes

- Evaluation of candidate's skills, values, problem-solving capacity, and potential fit
- Hiring decision based on comprehensive assessment and risk acknowledgment
