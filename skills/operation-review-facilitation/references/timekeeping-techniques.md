# Timekeeping Techniques for Organizing Manager

## Inconspicuous Gestures

### At 2 Minutes Remaining on a Visual
- Subtle finger tap on wrist
- Brief eye contact with presenter
- Light nod toward remaining visuals

### At 30 Seconds Remaining
- More pronounced wrist gesture
- Stand slightly if seated
- Clear throat softly

### Time Exceeded
- Stand up fully
- Walk toward presenter
- Verbal cue if needed: "Let's move to the next visual so we have time for your conclusion."

## Pacing Strategies

### If Running Early
- Allow more discussion on current visual
- Ask for audience questions
- Don't rush to end early

### If Running Late
- Reduce time on remaining visuals
- Summarize rather than present fully
- Offer to continue discussion offline

## Time Management Principles

**Respect the Schedule:**
- Late presenters disadvantage subsequent presenters
- Audience attention spans have limits

**Be Flexible:**
- Complex topics may need more time
- Simple topics can be covered quickly
- Adjust within reason

**Communicate Early:**
- Alert presenters to time pressure early
- Give them opportunity to self-adjust
- Avoid public embarrassment
