# Visual Aids Best Practices for Operation Reviews

## General Guidelines

### Content Design
- One main idea per visual
- Use clear, readable fonts (minimum 24pt for presentations)
- Limit text: use visuals, not documents
- Use color to highlight emphasis, not decoration

### Types of Visual Aids

**Tables:**
- Use for comparative data
- Highlight key rows/columns with color
- Keep headers clear

**Charts/Graphs:**
- Choose the right type for your data
- Label axes clearly
- Show trends, not just raw numbers

**Graphics:**
- Use diagrams to show processes or relationships
- Ensure they're large enough to see
- Use consistent style throughout

## Timing Calculation

### Rule of Thumb Formula
```
Total Time Needed = Number of Visual Aids × 4 minutes
```

### Examples

| Visual Aids | Presentation Time |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 5           | 20 minutes        |
| 10          | 40 minutes        |
| 15          | 60 minutes        |

### Time Allocation per Visual
- 2 minutes: presenter explanation
- 2 minutes: questions and discussion
