# Competence vs Achievement Drivers

## Competence-Driven

**Focus**: Job or task mastery.

**Behavior**:
- Sharpening own skill
- Trying to do better than the time before
- Perfecting techniques and methods

**Examples**:
- A violinist practicing daily
- A teenager perfecting a skateboard trick
- A programmer optimizing code for efficiency

**Management Approach**:
- Provide opportunities for skill development
- Offer technical challenges
- Recognize mastery and improvement
- Allow time for practice and refinement

## Achievement-Driven

**Focus**: Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors.

**Behavior**:
- Testing limits of capability
- Working at "boundary of their capability"
- Seeking challenging goals

**Behavioral Classification (Peg/Ring Experiment)**:

1. **Gamblers**: High risk, no influence on outcome
   - Take risks they cannot control
   - Motivated by thrill, not achievement

2. **Conservatives**: Very little risk
   - Avoid challenges
   - Stay within comfort zone

3. **Achievers**: Challenge themselves at boundary of capability
   - Take calculated risks
   - Test limits to improve
   - Optimal for peak performance

**Management Approach**:
- Set challenging but achievable goals
- Provide stretch assignments
- Recognize accomplishments
- Create competitive environment

## Commonality

Both types spontaneously try to test the outer limits of their abilities. The key difference is the focus:
- Competence: Mastery of specific skills/tasks
- Achievement: Testing limits across endeavors

- Seeks feedback on how to improve
- Values skill recognition

**Achievement-Driven**:
