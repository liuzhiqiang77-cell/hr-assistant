# MBO (Management by Objectives) Implementation Guide

## Core Principle

Set objectives at a difficulty level where the individual has only a "fifty-fifty chance" of making them, even if they push hard.

## Rationale

Output tends to be greater when striving for a level beyond immediate grasp, even if failure occurs half the time.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Define Objectives

**Characteristics of Good Objectives**:
- Specific and measurable
- Challenging but achievable (50% success rate)
- Aligned with organizational goals
- Time-bound

**Example**:
- Poor: "Improve sales"
- Good: "Increase regional sales by 25% in Q3"

### 2. Establish Success Probability

**Target**: 50% chance of success

**Too Easy (>80% success)**:
- Employee will coast
- Minimal performance improvement
- Boredom and disengagement

**Too Hard (<20% success)**:
- Employee will give up
- Demotivation
- Reduced effort

**Just Right (~50% success)**:
- Maximum effort exerted
- Peak performance achieved
- Even failure produces high output

### 3. Monitor Progress

- Regular check-ins
- Adjust support, not goals
- Track metrics objectively

### 4. Evaluate Results

**Focus on Effort and Output**:
- Did the employee push their limits?
- Was output higher than with easier goals?
- What was learned from the attempt?

**Reward Achievement and Effort**:
- Recognize successful completion
- Also recognize high-effort failures
- Emphasize growth and learning

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Setting Goals Too Easy**: Reduces motivation and output
2. **Setting Goals Too Hard**: Causes discouragement
3. **Changing Goals Mid-Period**: Undermines credibility
4. **Focusing Only on Success**: Misses learning from failure
5. **Ignoring Individual Capability**: Goals must be personalized

## Cultural Requirements

- Output-centered values
- Tolerance for failure
- Focus on growth and learning
- Recognition of effort, not just results
