# Candidate Interview Techniques

## When to Use
- You are conducting an interview session with a job candidate
- You have the candidate's resume and background information
- You need to assess technical skills, operational values, and problem-solving abilities

## Core Workflow

### 1. Ask Recommended Assessment Questions
Ask the following key questions to evaluate different aspects of the candidate:

**Projects and Recognition:**
- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."

**Self-Awareness:**
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"

**Value Proposition:**
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."

**Problem-Solving:**
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"

**Readiness:**
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"

**Achievements:**
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

### 2. Categorize Inquiry Coverage
Ensure your questions cover these four categories:

- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, weaknesses, technical competence
- **What They Did With Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures, application of learning
- **Discrepancies**: Learning from failures, problems in current position, areas for improvement
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new job, why the company should hire them, alignment with organizational values

### 3. Use Direct Questions
Employ blunt, direct questioning to elicit honest responses:
- Ask straightforward questions like "How good are you technically?"
- Observe the candidate's reaction carefully
- Gauge confidence vs. timidity in their response
- Directness often reveals actual capability more accurately than nuanced questions

### 4. Employ Hypothetical Situations
Test problem-solving capacity through scenarios:
- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps, software development workflow)
- Present a specific problem and ask them to solve it or calculate a result (e.g., finished cost of a product, resource allocation)
- Observe their ability to derive principles on the fly
- Evaluate their analytical approach and reasoning

### 5. Invite Candidate Questions
Ask: "What would you like to know about me, the company, or the job?"

Analyze their questions to determine:
- What they already know about the role/company
- What they value in a workplace or role
- How prepared and researched they are
- Their priorities and concerns

## Output
An evaluation covering:
- Candidate's technical skills and competence
- Operational values and alignment
- Problem-solving capacity and analytical ability
- Potential fit for the role and organization
- Confidence and self-awareness levels
