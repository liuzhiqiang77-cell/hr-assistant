# Motivation and Managerial Role

## When to Use
- A manager needs to improve output and the root cause is motivation
- You need to distinguish between motivation problems and capability problems
- You're managing knowledge workers vs. manual laborers
- You're tempted to try to "force" motivation directly

## Core Principles

### 1. Origin of Motivation
- Motivation must come from within the individual
- A manager cannot "do something to another person" to motivate them directly
- The manager's role is to create an environment in which motivated people can flourish

### 2. Define Success: Output vs. Attitude
- **Better motivation equals better performance**, NOT a change of attitude or feeling
- A subordinate saying "I feel motivated" means nothing
- Attitude is merely an indicator (a "window into the black box"), not the desired result
- The desired result is better performance at a given skill level

### 3. Contextual Approach: Fear vs. Humanistic

**Manual Labor:**
- Output is readily measurable
- Fear of punishment (e.g., loss of life/food) historically worked well

**Knowledge Workers:**
- Output is difficult to measure immediately
- Expectations are hard to state precisely
- Fear won't work as well ("fear won't work as well with computer architects as with galley slaves")
- New humanistic approaches are required

## Execution Steps

1. **Diagnose the Problem**: Confirm the issue is motivation, not capability
2. **Design the Environment**: Create conditions where motivated people can excel
3. **Focus on Output**: Measure performance, not attitude or feelings
4. **Adapt Approach**: Use humanistic methods for knowledge workers, measurable consequences for manual labor
5. **Avoid Direct Manipulation**: Don't try to force internal motivation; influence external conditions instead

## Key Constraint
Manager cannot force motivation directly; can only influence environment.
