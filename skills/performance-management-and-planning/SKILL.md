# Performance Management and Planning

## When to Use
- An employee is not performing their job duties
- Planning a new product or project
- Identifying gaps in current output
- Deciding where to invest time and energy in a project lifecycle
- Managing any form of work as production

## Output-Oriented Management

### Core Principle
All employees in an organization "produce" in some sense. Apply the principles and discipline of manufacturing to all forms of business enterprise.

### Production Mindset
Treat all work as production:
- Physical products: Manufacturing items
- Administrative work: Preparing bills, scheduling, paying
- Creative work: Creating software designs, writing advertising copy
- Managerial work: Managing the production of others

### Employee Production Categories (Example Model)
- 25% make the products
- 25% support production (supervise, maintain, engineer)
- 25% work in administration (schedule, bill, pay)
- 25% design, sell, and service products

## Employee Performance Diagnosis

### When to Diagnose
Use when an employee is not performing their job duties effectively.

### Diagnosis Procedure

1. **Identify the Performance Gap**
   - Observe that the employee is not meeting expectations
   - Document specific instances of underperformance

2. **Determine Root Cause**
   Categorize the issue into one of two buckets:

   | Category | Description | Solution |
   |----------|-------------|----------|
   | Can't do it | Employee lacks capability | Training |
   | Won't do it | Employee lacks motivation | Motivation |

3. **Select Intervention**
   - If **Can't do**: Provide training, coaching, or skill development
   - If **Won't do**: Apply motivational techniques, incentives, or consequences

4. **Apply the Constraint**
   - There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train
   - If training and motivation don't work, the role may not be a fit

## Product Planning Energy Principle

### Core Principle
Energy invested early in a process pays off 10x. Energy invested at the end pays off -10x.

### When to Apply
- Planning a new product
- Identifying gaps in current output
- Managing a project lifecycle

### Energy Allocation Strategy

1. **Analyze Today's Gap**
   - Any gap identified today represents a failure of planning in the past
   - Use this insight to prevent future gaps

2. **Invest Maximum Energy Early**
   - Focus on prevention and early design
   - Invest in thorough planning at the beginning
   - Return on investment: 10x multiplier

3. **Avoid Reliance on Late Fixes**
   - Do not count on fixing issues at the end of the program
   - Late fixes are costly and inefficient
   - Return on investment: -10x multiplier

4. **Strategic Implication**
   - Front-load effort in projects
   - Design quality in from the start
   - Prevent problems rather than fixing them

## Integrated Approach

### Managing Work as Production
1. Define the output clearly
2. Identify production steps
3. Measure output quality and quantity
4. Apply production discipline to all work types

### Diagnosing and Fixing Performance Issues
1. Identify the gap between expected and actual output
2. Determine if it's a capability or motivation issue
3. Apply the appropriate intervention (train or motivate)
4. Monitor results and adjust

### Planning for Success
1. Invest energy early in planning and design
2. Build quality into the process from the start
3. Monitor for gaps and address them early
4. Avoid reliance on end-stage fixes
