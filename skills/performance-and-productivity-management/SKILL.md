# Performance and Productivity Management

## When to Use This Skill
- Employee is not performing their job duties
- Planning products or projects
- Managing organizational productivity
- Making promotion or hiring decisions
- Diagnosing root causes of underperformance
- Allocating resources across project lifecycle

## Part 1: Output-Oriented Management

### Core Principle
All employees "produce" in some sense—whether making products, preparing bills, creating designs, or writing copy. Apply manufacturing discipline to all work.

### Execution Steps

**Step 1: Define Output for Every Role**
- Identify what each role "produces"
- Make output tangible and measurable
- Ensure output aligns with organizational goals

**Step 2: Apply Production Principles**
- Use manufacturing discipline for all work
- Treat all activities as forms of production
- Apply systematic methods to management work

**Step 3: Categorize Production Roles**
Example breakdown (Intel model):
- 25% make the products
- 25% support production (supervise, maintain, engineer)
- 25% work in administration (schedule, bill, pay)
- 25% design, sell, and service products

**Step 4: Manage Managers as Producers**
- Apply production principles to managerial work
- Measure managerial output (team's output, not individual tasks)
- Use systematic approach to management activities

## Part 2: Employee Performance Diagnosis

### When to Apply
- Employee is not performing job duties
- Performance is below expectations
- Output is insufficient or poor quality

### Two-Category Diagnosis Framework

**Category 1: Can't Do It (Capability Issue)**
- Employee lacks necessary skills
- Employee lacks necessary knowledge
- Employee lacks necessary resources
- Employee lacks physical or mental ability

**Intervention: Train the employee**
- Provide skill training
- Provide knowledge transfer
- Ensure adequate resources
- Consider role fit

**Category 2: Won't Do It (Motivation Issue)**
- Employee has skills but doesn't apply them
- Employee chooses not to perform
- Employee lacks drive or engagement

**Intervention: Motivate the employee**
- Clarify expectations and consequences
- Provide incentives and rewards
- Address underlying issues
- Consider if role is wrong fit

### Critical Constraint
There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than:
1. Motivate
2. Train

If neither works, the employee is not suitable for the role.

### Execution Steps

**Step 1: Observe Performance**
- Document specific performance gaps
- Gather objective data
- Identify patterns

**Step 2: Diagnose Root Cause**
- Ask: "Can they do it or won't they do it?"
- Test for capability: Provide training, observe improvement
- Test for motivation: Provide incentives, observe improvement

**Step 3: Select Intervention**
- If Can't: Provide training, resources, or support
- If Won't: Provide motivation, clarity, or consequences

**Step 4: Implement and Monitor**
- Apply selected intervention
- Set timeline for improvement
- Monitor progress objectively

**Step 5: Escalate if Needed**
- If no improvement after training and motivation
- Consider role reassignment
- Consider employment termination

## Part 3: Product Planning Energy Principle

### Core Principle
Energy invested early in process pays off 10x. Energy invested late pays off -10x.

### When to Apply
- Planning any product or project
- Identifying gaps in current output
- Allocating resources across lifecycle

### Execution Steps

**Step 1: Analyze Today's Gap**
- Recognize any gap today represents past planning failure
- Identify root causes of current gaps
- Learn from past planning deficiencies

**Step 2: Allocate Maximum Energy Early**
- Invest in upfront planning and design
- Focus on prevention rather than correction
- Return on Investment: 10x multiplier

**Step 3: Minimize Energy Late**
- Avoid reliance on last-minute fixes
- Prevent issues that require end-stage intervention
- Cost of late fixes: -10x multiplier

**Step 4: Apply Strategic Implication**
- Focus efforts on prevention
- Invest in early design phases
- Build quality in from the start

### Energy Allocation Timeline

**Phase 1: Concept and Planning (10x ROI)**
- Market research
- Requirements definition
- Architecture design
- Risk assessment
- Resource planning

**Phase 2: Design and Development (5x ROI)**
- Detailed design
- Prototyping
- Early testing
- Iteration based on feedback

**Phase 3: Implementation and Launch (1x ROI)**
- Production/development
- Quality assurance
- Launch preparation

**Phase 4: Maintenance and Fixes (-10x ROI)**
- Bug fixes
- Emergency patches
- Rework
- Customer support for issues

## Part 4: The Peter Principle

### Core Concept
"In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

### When to Apply
- Making promotion decisions
- Designing career progression systems
- Evaluating organizational structure
- Assessing management effectiveness

### The Mechanism

**Step 1: Selection Based on Current Performance**
- Candidate selected based on performance in current role
- Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to intended role"
- Success in current role = promotion eligibility

**Step 2: Promotion Continues**
- Employee promoted because of current success
- Each promotion assumes success will continue
- No assessment of fit for new role

**Step 3: Reaching Incompetence**
- Employee eventually promoted to role beyond capabilities
- No longer competent in new role
- Promotion stops

**Step 4: Stuck at Incompetence Level**
- Employee remains in role they can't perform
- Can't be promoted further (incompetent)
- Won't be demoted (rarely done)
- Stuck at "level of incompetence"

### Prevention Strategies

**Strategy 1: Competency-Based Selection**
- Define competencies required for target role
- Assess candidates against target role competencies
- Don't assume current success predicts future success

**Strategy 2: Parallel Tracks**
- Create technical track for individual contributors
- Create management track for people leaders
- Allow advancement without management role

**Strategy 3: Trial Assignments**
- Test candidates in target role before promotion
- Use acting or interim assignments
- Assess fit before permanent promotion

**Strategy 4: Demotion Mechanism**
- Create culture where demotion is acceptable
- Allow moves back to previous roles
- Remove stigma from role changes

### Detection Signs
- Manager struggling in role after successful previous performance
- Team performance declining under new manager
- Manager overwhelmed by role requirements
- Previously high performer now failing
