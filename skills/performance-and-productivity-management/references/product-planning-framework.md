# Product Planning Energy Allocation Framework

## The Energy Multiplier Effect

```
Early Investment ROI = 10x
Late Investment ROI = -10x
```

**Implication:** Every dollar/hour spent early saves $10/hours late. Every dollar/hour spent late wastes $10 that could have been saved earlier.

## Phase-by-Phase Energy Allocation

### Phase 1: Discovery and Strategy (Highest Leverage)
**Time Allocation:** 20% of timeline, 40% of energy

**Activities:**
- Market research and customer interviews
- Competitive analysis
- Problem validation
- Opportunity sizing
- Strategic fit assessment

**Energy Focus:**
- Deep understanding of customer needs
- Identification of true problems (not symptoms)
- Validation of market opportunity
- Alignment with business strategy

**Common Mistakes (High Cost):**
- Skipping market research
- Assuming customer needs
- Ignoring competitive landscape
- Building wrong thing

### Phase 2: Requirements and Design (High Leverage)
**Time Allocation:** 20% of timeline, 30% of energy

**Activities:**
- Requirements definition and prioritization
- User experience design
- Technical architecture
- Prototyping and validation
- Risk assessment

**Energy Focus:**
- Clear, testable requirements
- Intuitive user experience
- Scalable technical design
- Early validation with users

**Common Mistakes (High Cost):**
- Vague or changing requirements
- Poor user experience design
- Non-scalable architecture
- Skipping prototyping

### Phase 3: Planning and Preparation (Medium Leverage)
**Time Allocation:** 10% of timeline, 15% of energy

**Activities:**
- Detailed project planning
- Resource allocation
- Team assembly and training
- Tool and environment setup
- Risk mitigation planning

**Energy Focus:**
- Realistic timelines and milestones
- Right people in right roles
- Proper tools and infrastructure
- Clear communication plans

**Common Mistakes (Medium Cost):**
- Unrealistic planning
- Under-resourced teams
- Poor team coordination
- Inadequate tools

### Phase 4: Development and Implementation (Low Leverage)
**Time Allocation:** 40% of timeline, 10% of energy

**Activities:**
- Coding/production
- Testing and quality assurance
- Integration
- Documentation

**Energy Focus:**
- Execution excellence
- Quality standards
- Efficient processes
- Continuous integration

**Common Mistakes (Low Cost if planned well):**
- Poor code quality
- Insufficient testing
- Integration issues
- Scope creep

### Phase 5: Launch and Post-Launch (Negative Leverage if unplanned)
**Time Allocation:** 10% of timeline, 5% of energy (if planned well)

**Activities:**
- Launch preparation
- Go-to-market execution
- User training and support
- Monitoring and feedback
- Issue resolution

**Energy Focus:**
- Smooth launch execution
- Effective user adoption
- Rapid issue resolution
- Continuous improvement

**Common Mistakes (Very High Cost if unplanned):**
- Poor launch execution
- User confusion
- Critical bugs in production
- Emergency fixes

## The Gap Analysis Framework

### Today's Gap = Past Planning Failure

**When you identify a gap today, ask:**
1. What planning failed to prevent this?
2. What early investment was missed?
3. What assumption was wrong?
4. How can we prevent this gap in future?

**Gap Categories:**

**Product Gaps:**
- Missing features
- Poor user experience
- Performance issues
- Quality problems

**Planning Root Causes:**
- Insufficient user research
- Inadequate requirements
- Poor design decisions
- Incomplete testing

**Process Gaps:**
- Inefficient workflows
- Poor coordination
- Communication breakdowns
- Resource constraints

**Planning Root Causes:**
- Inadequate process design
- Poor team structure
- Insufficient tools
- Unrealistic resource planning

**Market Gaps:**
- Misaligned with customer needs
- Behind competition
- Poor positioning
- Wrong pricing

**Planning Root Causes:**
- Insufficient market research
- Poor competitive analysis
- Weak value proposition
- Ineffective go-to-market strategy

| Planning | 5x ROI | -5x ROI | Invest early |
| Development | 1x ROI | 1x ROI | Execute efficiently |
| Testing | 5x ROI early, -10x late | -10x ROI | Test early and often |
| Documentation | 2x ROI | -5x ROI | Document as you go |
| Training | 5x ROI | -10x ROI | Train early |
| Launch prep | 5x ROI | -10x ROI | Prepare early |
