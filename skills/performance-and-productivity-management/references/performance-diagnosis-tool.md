# Employee Performance Diagnosis Tool

## Step-by-Step Diagnostic Process

### Step 1: Define Expected Performance

**Clarify Requirements:**
- What specific outputs are expected?
- What quality standards must be met?
- What timelines must be achieved?
- What behaviors are required?

**Document Expectations:**
- Job description
- Performance goals
- Success metrics
- Behavioral expectations

### Step 2: Measure Actual Performance

**Gather Objective Data:**
- Output quantity and quality metrics
- Timeline adherence
- Error rates
- Customer/peer feedback

**Document Specific Gaps:**
- What is not being delivered?
- How far below expectations?
- How long has this been occurring?
- What is the impact?

### Step 3: Test for Capability (Can't Do)

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- Does the employee have necessary skills?
- Does the employee understand what to do?
- Does the employee have necessary resources?
- Is the task physically/mentally possible for them?

**Capability Tests:**
- Ask employee to explain the task
- Observe employee performing the task
- Provide training and observe improvement
- Remove barriers and observe improvement

**Indicators of Capability Issue:**
- Effort is visible but results are poor
- Employee expresses frustration or confusion
- Performance improves with training or resources
- Employee wants to succeed but can't

### Step 4: Test for Motivation (Won't Do)

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- Does the employee have the skills but not apply them?
- Is performance inconsistent (good when motivated, poor when not)?
- Does employee choose not to perform certain tasks?
- Is there lack of effort or engagement?

**Motivation Tests:**
- Clarify consequences of poor performance
- Offer incentives for good performance
- Address personal issues or conflicts
- Observe response to motivation efforts

**Indicators of Motivation Issue:**
- Performance varies with effort level
- Employee performs well when interested, poorly when not
- Skills exist but aren't applied consistently
- Employee doesn't seem to care about poor performance

### Step 5: Select and Implement Intervention

**Capability Interventions:**
- Provide formal training
- Assign mentor or coach
- Provide better tools or resources
- Redesign job to fit capabilities
- Consider role reassignment

**Motivation Interventions:**
- Clarify expectations and consequences
- Provide performance-based incentives
- Address personal or team conflicts
- Connect work to meaningful outcomes
- Consider if role is wrong fit

### Step 6: Monitor and Adjust

**Set Timeline:**
- Specific timeframe for improvement
- Regular check-ins scheduled
- Clear metrics for success

**Track Progress:**
- Document performance changes
- Gather feedback from employee
- Assess intervention effectiveness

**Decision Points:**
- If improving: Continue and support
- If not improving: Try different intervention
- If still not improving: Consider role change or termination
