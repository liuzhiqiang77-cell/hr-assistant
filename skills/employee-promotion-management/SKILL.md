# Employee Promotion Management

## When to Use
Apply this framework when:
- Evaluating employees for promotion based on performance ratings
- Managing employees who have been promoted but are struggling
- Considering recycling (demotion) for underperforming promoted employees

## Promotion Performance Cycle

### The Cycle Logic
1. **Initial State**: Employee at Job 1 performing at 'average' level ('meets the requirements')

2. **Improvement Phase**: Through training and motivation, performance improves to 'above-average' ('exceeds the requirements')

3. **Promotion Trigger**: Once employee 'exceeds requirements,' they are 'promotable' → promoted to Job 2

4. **Performance Reset**: Upon entering Job 2, employee initially performs only at 'meets requirements' due to new challenges

5. **Cycle Repetition**: With experience, employee again improves to 'exceeds requirements,' leading to another promotion

6. **Cycle Conclusion**: Cycle repeats until employee settles at 'meets requirements' and is no longer promoted (reaching 'level of incompetence')

### Critical Constraint
**If an employee 'exceeds requirements' but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will 'atrophy' and performance will permanently return to 'meets requirements.'**

## Employee Recycling Procedure

### When to Use
Execute recycling when:
- A promoted employee performs below-average for an extended period
- The person has been promoted into a position 'so much over their head'
- Previous role success is confirmed

### Execution Steps
1. **Identification**: Recognize the employee is over their head in the new role

2. **Solution Selection**: Choose to 'recycle' rather than terminate

3. **Definition**: Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion

4. **Management Accountability**: Management must admit fault for misjudging readiness

5. **Implementation**: Take 'forthright and deliberate steps' to place the person in a job they can do

6. **Support System**: Support the employee in the face of likely 'embarrassment'

7. **Transparency**: Execute the recycling 'openly' to reduce stigma

8. **Expected Outcome**: Embarrassment will be 'short-lived'; employee will regain confidence

9. **Future Value**: Once confidence is regained, employee becomes an 'excellent candidate for another promotion' at a later time

### Prohibited Action
**Do NOT force the employee to leave the company.** Reject the rationalization that 'It is better that we let him go, for his own sake.'

## Constraints
- Does not apply to 'noncompetitors' who have no motivation to do more
- Must overcome societal stigma regarding demotion
- Must overcome management tendency to view it as personal failure
