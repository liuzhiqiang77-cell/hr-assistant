# Delegation and Task Monitoring

## When to Use This Skill
- Delegating tasks to subordinates to free up managerial time
- Establishing accountability for work assigned to others
- Determining how closely to monitor delegated work
- Assessing whether a subordinate is ready for increased responsibility
- Preventing "customer tuition" (mistakes paid for by customers)

## Establish Prerequisites for Delegation

### Share Operational Values
Before effective delegation can occur, ensure commonality of:
- Operational values
- Priorities
- Preferences (how the organization works together)

**Why**: The supervisor is accountable for subordinate output and cannot delegate without shared values.

### Supervisor Teaching Duty
- Responsibility for transmitting values rests with the supervisor
- Teach correct operational values early
- Do not allow subordinates to learn through customer-impacting mistakes

### Ensure Common Information Base
Delegator and delegatee must share:
- Common information base
- Operational ideas

**Without this**: Delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage.

## Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

### Definition
TRM is a combination of:
- Achievement orientation (drive to achieve)
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience **specific to the task**

### Key Characteristics
- **Task-specific**: A person can have high TRM in one job and low in another
- **Dynamic**: TRM can change day by day or hour by hour
- **Context-dependent**: Even seasoned managers have low TRM in new environments or when pace accelerates

### Distinguish from General Competence
Do not confuse general maturity with task-relevant maturity. High general maturity does not guarantee high TRM in a new role.

## Delegation Strategy

### Task Selection Rule
When given a choice, **delegate activities familiar to you rather than unfamiliar ones**

**Reasoning**: Easier to monitor tasks you know best.

### Avoid Insincere Delegation
- Do not emotionally hold onto tasks while pretending to delegate
- If you keep a task because you enjoy it, make it a conscious decision rather than a charade

### Responsibility Principle
**"Delegation without follow-through is abdication."**
- You never wash your hands of the task
- You remain responsible for its accomplishment

## Monitor Delegated Tasks

### Purpose
Monitoring ensures activity proceeds in line with expectations and is the only practical way to ensure results.

### Quality Assurance Principle 1: Timing
Monitor at the **lowest-added-value stage** of the process.

**Example**: Review rough drafts of reports rather than waiting for final polished versions to catch basic content problems early.

### Quality Assurance Principle 2: Sampling
- Do not check 100% of details
- Go into details randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress

### Adjust Frequency Based on TRM
- **Newly delegated tasks**: Increase monitoring frequency
- **Improving performance**: Decrease intensity over time
- **Low TRM**: Monitor more closely
- **High TRM**: Monitor less frequently

### Avoid Meddling
- Monitoring should focus on outcomes and direction
- Do not prescribe specific activities (that's meddling, not monitoring)
