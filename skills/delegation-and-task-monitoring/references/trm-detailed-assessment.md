# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) Detailed Assessment

## Definition
Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) is a combination of:
1. The degree of the subordinate's achievement orientation
2. Readiness to take responsibility
3. Education, training, and experience **specific to the task**

## Key Characteristics

### Task-Specificity
TRM is very specific to the task at hand. It is entirely possible for a person or group to have:
- High TRM in one job
- Low TRM in another job

### Dynamic Nature
TRM can change:
- Day by day
- Hour by hour

### Situational Factors
Even a seasoned manager may have low TRM if:
- The environment is new
- The content is unfamiliar
- The tasks are novel

TRM can also drop if:
- The pace of the job accelerates
- The job itself abruptly changes

## Distinguishing TRM from General Competence

**Do not confuse** a manager's general competence and maturity with their task-relevant maturity.

**Example**: A highly competent senior manager assigned to lead a marketing team for the first time may have:
- **High general maturity**: Years of management experience, leadership skills
- **Low TRM in marketing**: No direct marketing experience, unfamiliar with marketing tactics and metrics

## TRM Components Assessment

| Component | Assessment Questions |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Achievement Orientation | Is the subordinate driven to achieve results in this specific task? |
| Readiness for Responsibility | Are they willing to be accountable for outcomes of this work? |
| Education/Training | Do they have relevant training specifically for this task? |
| Experience | Have they performed this specific task before? How successfully? |

## TRM and Management Style

As TRM increases, the manager's style should progress:

| TRM Level | Management Style |
|-----------|------------------|
| Low | Structured, task-specific instruction, close monitoring |
| Medium | Goal-setting, problem-solving together, moderate monitoring |
| High | Outcome-focused, minimal monitoring, trusted autonomy |

**Note**: This progression requires shared operational values to be effective.
