# Operational Values Reference

## Definition

Operational values are "the correct way to do things" and priorities within the organization. They encompass how an organization works together.

## Why Shared Values Matter

1. **Accountability**: The supervisor is accountable for subordinate output
2. **Delegation prerequisite**: You cannot effectively delegate without a shared set of values
3. **Internalization**: As TRM grows, structure moves from externally imposed to internally adopted

## Supervisor's Responsibility

- Transmit common values to subordinates
- Teach the correct operational values early on
- Prevent "customer tuition"—mistakes paid for by customers

## Example Scenario

A supervisor ensures that all engineers understand the company's value on safety protocols before delegating inspection tasks. This shared understanding allows the supervisor to delegate with confidence that safety will not be compromised.
