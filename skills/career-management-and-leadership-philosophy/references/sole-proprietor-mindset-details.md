# Sole Proprietor Mindset: Detailed Framework

## The Competitive Landscape

### Global Market Reality
- Capital and work can go anywhere on earth
- Domestic markets can be supplied from anywhere
- Information revolution "does away with hiding places anywhere, in any line of work"

### Competitive Ratios
For every position you compete for:
- 1,000+ people in your local area
- 100,000+ people in your country
- 1,000,000+ people globally

### Your True Rivals
- NOT: Your coworkers in the same department
- NOT: People in your same company
- ACTUALLY: Anyone in the world who can do your job

## Career Management Daily Practices

### Morning Routine
1. Review: What value will I add today?
2. Connect: What information do I need to gather?
3. Innovate: What new thing will I try?

### Weekly Review
1. Value audit: Did I increase output this week?
2. Network check: Am I connected to key information sources?
3. Learning log: What new skills did I acquire?

### Quarterly Assessment

## Internal Threat Management

### Signs You're Blocking Others
- Junior employees express frustration about lack of advancement
- Your boss starts having "development conversations" with you

2. **Move out**: Transfer to different department or company

### The "In the Way" Test
Ask yourself:
- If I left tomorrow, would the team be more productive?
- Is my presence preventing someone more qualified from advancing?
- Am I adding unique value or just occupying space?
