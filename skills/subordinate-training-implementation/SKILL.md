# Subordinate Training Implementation

## When to Use
- You are a manager deciding to implement a training program for subordinates
- You are preparing to teach or training others for the first time
- You need to scale training across a large organization

## Core Procedure

### Phase 1: Identify Training Needs
- Create a list of topics subordinates should be trained in
- Do not limit the scope; include simple tasks (e.g., taking calls) and broad concepts (e.g., objectives, value systems)
- Ask subordinates what they feel they need to uncover unknown needs

### Phase 2: Resource Inventory and Prioritization
- Take inventory of available manager-teachers and instructional materials
- Assign priorities to the items on the training list

### Phase 3: Initial Course Design
- Start unambitiously with one short course (three to four lectures) on the most urgent subject
- Be aware that explaining skills you possess is harder than practicing them
- Avoid the temptation to provide excessive background information that obscures the course objective

### Phase 4: Preparation and Launch
- Set a schedule with deadlines to prevent getting bogged down
- Create an outline for the whole course
- Develop only the first lecture and begin teaching

### Phase 5: Iterative Development
- Develop the second lecture only after delivering the first
- Regard the first delivery as a 'throwaway'; accept it will be unsatisfactory
- To mitigate damage and improve the course, teach the first version to knowledgeable subordinates who can provide interaction and critique without confusion

### Phase 6: Scalability Assessment
- Determine if you can teach all members personally or if it requires many repetitions (e.g., ten or twenty courses)
- If the organization is large, use the first set of lectures to train a few instructors (train-the-trainer model)

### Phase 7: Feedback and Evaluation
- After the course, request anonymous critiques from employees
- Use a form prompting for numerical ratings and open-ended questions
- Expect mixed feedback (too detailed, too superficial, just right in equal balance)
- Aim to satisfy yourself that objectives are met, rather than trying to please everyone

## First-Time Teaching Mindset

### Acknowledge the Difficulty
- Teaching is "hard work" involving lecture preparation and handling unpredictable questions
- Expect to discover knowledge gaps: Even with long-term job experience, you will realize "how much you don't know"
- **Key Principle**: "Much deeper knowledge of a task is required to teach that task than simply to do it"
- **Analogy**: Consider the difficulty of "explaining to someone over the phone how to drive a stick-shift car"
- Do not be discouraged by this discovery; it is "typical"

### Recognize the Personal Learning Benefit
- **Primary Beneficiary**: The instructor ("Guess who will have learned most from the course? You.")
- **Outcome**: The course development process provides "crispness" to the instructor's understanding of their own work
- This improved understanding makes the effort "extremely worthwhile" in itself

### Leverage Emotional Rewards
- **Immediate Reward**: A successful training process is "nothing short of exhilarating"
- **Ultimate Reward**: Seeing a subordinate practice the taught material creates a "warm feeling" that "dwarfs" the exhilaration
- **Strategic Advice**: "Relish the exhilaration and warmth" to build resilience/motivation for "tackling the second course"

## Key Variables
- **training_list**: List of identified training topics ranging from simple to complex
- **course_length**: Recommended initial duration of 3-4 lectures
- **feedback_form**: Tool for collecting numerical ratings and open-ended comments
- **instructor_experience**: Length of time the instructor has performed the job they are teaching

## Constraints
- Manager must accept that the first iteration of training will be unsatisfactory
- Requires availability of knowledgeable subordinates for initial pilot
