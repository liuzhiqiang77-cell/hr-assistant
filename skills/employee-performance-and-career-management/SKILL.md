# Employee Performance and Career Management

## When to Use
- Diagnosing why an employee is not performing
- Helping employees manage their careers
- Making promotion decisions
- Addressing underperformance
- Planning personal career development

## Part 1: Employee Performance Diagnosis

### The Core Framework

When an employee is not performing their job, determine the root cause:

```
Can't do it → Training issue
Won't do it → Motivation issue
```

### Decision Tree

1. **Observe**: Employee is not performing job duties
2. **Diagnose**: Determine if it's capability or motivation
3. **Intervene**:
   - If Can't do: Train the employee
   - If Won't do: Motivate the employee

### Key Principle

There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train.

## Part 2: Sole Proprietor Career Mindset

### Core Concept

You are not an employee. You are a business with one employee: yourself.

### Key Principles

1. **Own Your Career**: Nobody owes you a career; you own it as a sole proprietor

2. **Global Competition**: You compete with millions of similar businesses globally, not just fellow workers

3. **Continuous Value Addition**: Enhance your value every day

### Daily Actions
- Continually dedicate yourself to retaining competitive advantage
- Learn and adapt constantly
- Be willing to move from job to job, or industry to industry
- Retrench if necessary to start again

### The Three Self-Assessment Questions

**Question 1: Value Addition**
- Ask: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"
- Action: Look for ways to make things truly better
- Standard: Every hour should increase output or value of people you're responsible for

**Question 2: Connectivity**
- Ask: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"
- Check: Don't wait for supervisor to interpret events
- Status: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people"

**Question 3: Innovation**
- Ask: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"
- Action: Personally try new things; don't just read about them
- Warning: Don't wait for others to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of it

### Internal Threats (Slow/No-Growth Environments)

**The Threat**: Ambitious junior employees blocked by your position

**The Boss's Dilemma**: Choose between retaining you (good job, blocking others) or promoting the junior

**Your Responsibility**: Don't be "in the way"—move up or move on

## Part 3: The Peter Principle

### The Principle

Managers rise to the level of their incompetence.

### How It Works

1. Selection is based on performance in current role
2. Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"
3. Employee continues to be promoted until reaching a role they're not skilled for
4. Employee stops being promoted once no longer competent

### Prevention Strategies

1. **Assess intended role competencies**, not just current performance
2. **Evaluate skills required for the new position**
3. **Consider different career tracks** (technical vs. managerial)
4. **Provide training before promotion**, not after

## Constraints
- Assumes role and expectations are clearly defined
- Does not apply if selection is based on competencies specific to intended role
- Does not apply if skills required for new role are identical to current role
- Does not apply to environments with absolute job security (rare/non-existent)
