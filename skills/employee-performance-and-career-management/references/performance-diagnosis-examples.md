# Employee Performance Diagnosis: Examples

## Can't Do (Capability) Examples

### Example 1: Technical Skill Gap
**Situation**: Software engineer cannot complete assigned tasks using new framework
**Diagnosis**: Can't do—lacks knowledge of the framework
**Intervention**: Provide training on the framework, pair with experienced developer

### Example 2: Process Knowledge
**Situation**: New sales rep not meeting quota because doesn't know sales process
**Diagnosis**: Can't do—doesn't understand the methodology
**Intervention**: Formal sales training, shadow top performers

### Example 3: Tool Proficiency
**Situation**: Analyst producing slow, error-prone reports
**Diagnosis**: Can't do—doesn't know advanced Excel features
**Intervention**: Excel training, provide templates

## Won't Do (Motivation) Examples

### Example 1: Effort Issue
**Situation**: Experienced sales rep knows process but not making calls
**Diagnosis**: Won't do—lacks motivation
**Intervention**: Commission structure change, performance coaching, clear consequences

### Example 2: Attitude Problem
**Situation**: Developer capable but refuses to follow code review process
**Diagnosis**: Won't do—resistance to process
**Intervention**: Explain importance, link to team success, address behavioral issue

### Example 3: Engagement Drop
**Situation**: Previously high performer now doing minimum required
**Diagnosis**: Won't do—disengaged
**Intervention**: Discuss career goals, provide new challenges, address burnout

## Mixed Cases

Sometimes both factors exist:

**Situation**: Employee struggling with new responsibilities and also seems disengaged
**Approach**: Address capability first (training), then motivation (coaching)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Motivating a Capability Issue
- Trying to inspire someone who literally doesn't know how
- Result: Frustration for both parties

### Mistake 2: Training a Motivation Issue
- Sending someone to training when they already know how but won't do it
- Result: Waste of time, resentment

### Mistake 3: Not Diagnosing at All
- Assuming it's one or the other without investigation
- Result: Wrong intervention, continued poor performance
