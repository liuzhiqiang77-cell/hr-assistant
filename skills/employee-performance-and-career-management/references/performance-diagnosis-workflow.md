# Employee Performance Diagnosis Workflow

## Step 1: Identify Performance Gap

- Compare actual performance to expected performance
- Document specific instances of underperformance
- Gather objective data where possible

## Step 2: Determine Root Cause

### Diagnostic Questions

**Capability Indicators (Can't):**
- Employee tries but fails to meet standards
- Lack of knowledge or skills evident
- Performance improves temporarily with guidance but regresses
- Employee expresses frustration with inability to perform

**Motivation Indicators (Won't):**
- Employee has demonstrated capability in the past
- Performance varies with interest/rewards
- Employee meets standards when closely supervised
- Employee expresses disinterest or resistance

### Decision Matrix

```
Has employee performed this task successfully before?
│
├─ Yes → Likely Motivation Issue (Won't)
└─ No → Likely Capability Issue (Can't)
    │
    └─ Has employee received proper training?
        │
        ├─ Yes → Likely Motivation Issue (Won't)
        └─ No → Capability Issue (Can't)
```

## Step 3: Select Intervention

### For Capability Issues (Can't)

1. **Assess Training Needs**
   - Identify specific skill gaps
   - Determine best training method (formal, on-the-job, mentoring)

2. **Implement Training**
   - Set clear learning objectives
   - Provide resources and support
   - Establish timeline for improvement

3. **Monitor Progress**
   - Track skill acquisition
   - Provide feedback during learning process
   - Adjust approach if needed

4. **Evaluate Results**
   - Has performance improved to acceptable levels?
   - If no, consider role realignment or separation

### For Motivation Issues (Won't)

1. **Understand Motivation Barriers**
   - Conduct one-on-one discussion
   - Identify demotivators (lack of recognition, unclear goals, personal issues)
   - Understand employee's career aspirations

2. **Apply Motivation Strategies**
   - Clarify expectations and consequences
   - Provide recognition for achievements
   - Connect work to meaningful outcomes
   - Offer development opportunities
   - Address interpersonal conflicts

3. **Set Improvement Plan**
   - Define specific behavioral changes needed
   - Establish timeline and milestones
   - Document consequences for non-improvement

4. **Monitor and Follow Through**
   - Provide regular feedback
- Recognize improvements
- Implement consequences if no change

## Step 4: Document and Follow Up

- Document diagnosis and intervention plan
- Schedule regular check-ins
- Adjust approach based on response
- Escalate to HR if performance doesn't improve

## Common Pitfalls

- Assuming capability issue when it's motivation (or vice versa)
- Providing training for motivation issues
- Trying to motivate capability issues
- Not documenting the process
- Failing to follow through on consequences
