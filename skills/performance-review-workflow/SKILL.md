description: Use this skill when conducting performance reviews, particularly those containing mixed positive and negative assessments. Covers the complete workflow from preparation (data gathering, brainstorming, message formulation) through delivery (The Three L's: Level, Listen, Leave Yourself Out). Ensures reviews are credible, well-supported with evidence, and delivered effectively so the subordinate understands and accepts the feedback.

# Performance Review Workflow

This skill guides you through preparing and delivering effective performance reviews.

## Phase 1: Preparation

**When to use:** Preparing for a performance review containing both positive and negative assessments.

### Step 1: Data Scanning
Review all available material:
- Progress reports
- Performance against quarterly objectives
- One-on-one meeting notes

### Step 2: Brainstorming (The Worksheet)
- Sit with a blank piece of paper
- Write "everything down" regarding the subordinate's performance
- **Do not edit in your head**—include "Things major, minor, and trivial" in no particular order
- **Key Insight**: Writing items down does not commit you to doing anything

### Step 3: Documentation Removal
Once you run out of items, "put all of your supporting documentation away."

### Step 4: Relationship Analysis
- Look for relationships between items on the worksheet
- Identify if items are "different manifestations of the same phenomenon" or indications of why strengths/weaknesses exist

### Step 5: Message Formulation
- Convert identified relationships into "messages" for the subordinate
- Examples: "Good results on planning system," "Inconsistent follow-through"

### Step 6: Evidence Gathering
- From the worksheet, "draw conclusions and specific examples to support them"
- Each message should have concrete evidence

### Step 7: Filtering
- Ask yourself: Will the subordinate be able to remember all the messages chosen?
- If not, "delete the less important ones"
- Excluded items can be taken up in the next review

### Step 8: Handling Surprises
- Ideally, regular supervision should prevent surprises
- However, if the worksheet reveals a message that "startles you," you must deliver it to improve performance
- **Action**: "Swallow hard and bring it up."

## Phase 2: Delivery (The Three L's)

**When to use:** Delivering a performance review or assessment to a subordinate.

### The First L: Level
You must **level** with your subordinate.

**Requirement**: Be totally frank.

**Rationale**: The credibility and integrity of the entire system depend on your being totally frank.

**Challenge**: Do not be surprised to find that praising someone in a straightforward fashion can be just as hard as criticizing him without embarrassment.

### The Second L: Listen
Employ your entire arsenal of sensory capabilities to ensure points are interpreted by the subordinate's brain.

**Goal**: Transmit thoughts from your brain to theirs—words are just the means, getting the right thought communicated is the end.

**Constraints**:
- Do NOT use a tape recorder to confirm words used
- Do not imitate professors who avoid eye contact
- Supervisor's personal emotions should not influence the content

#### Identify Barriers
Watch for signs that the subordinate is:
- Too emotional to understand clear points
- Preoccupied trying to formulate answers rather than listening
- Tuned out (e.g., thinking of going fishing) as a defense mechanism, especially if the message is laden with conflict

#### Verification Techniques
- Watch the person you are talking to
- Check for appropriate verbal and nonverbal responses
- Check if they allow themselves to receive your message

#### Responsibility
If responses do not completely assure you that the message has gotten through:
- Keep at it until you are satisfied that you have been heard and understood
- If not understood, explain things again or explain things in a different way
- Do not look away (like at a blackboard) to avoid confirming the presentation is murky

### The Third L: Leave Yourself Out
Ensure the review focuses solely on the subordinate.

**Principle**: The performance review is about and for your subordinate.

**Constraints**:
- Keep your own insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or other emotions out of it
- At issue are the subordinate's problems; it is the subordinate's day in court

**Emotion Management**: Control strong emotions (similar to stage fright) so they do not affect your task, acknowledging they may well up regardless of experience.

## Key Principles

### Preparation
- Write everything down without filtering first
- Identify relationships and themes before formulating messages
- Prioritize to ensure the subordinate can retain key points
- Deliver surprising truths—they improve performance

### Delivery
- Be totally frank with both praise and criticism
- Confirm understanding through active observation, not just words
- The review is about the subordinate, not your emotions
- Adjust your delivery until the message is understood
