# Performance Rating and Evaluation

## When to Use
- Rating a manager's or supervisor's performance
- Evaluating employees in management roles (e.g., Materials Support Supervisor)
- Organization has performed poorly and individual ratings need adjustment
- Determining promotion eligibility for management positions

## The Potential Trap Rule

### Step 1: Assess Substance Over Form
- Evaluate actual performance and real output
- **Ignore "potential" defined as form**: knowledge, handling oneself well, looking like a manager

### Step 2: Apply the Organization Cap
**RULE**: The performance rating of a manager **cannot be higher** than the rating accorded to his organization.

### Step 3: Enforce Consequences for Poor Organizational Performance
If the business unit:
- Lost money
- Missed revenue forecasts
- Slipped schedules
- Showed poor internal measures

**Then**: The manager cannot receive a high rating.

### Step 4: Reject Excuses
- Reject claims that the organization failed but the manager is "outstanding"
- Avoid signaling that "acting" like a manager is sufficient
- Reinforce that "performing" like a manager is the requirement

## Management Role Evaluation Framework

### Core Responsibilities Assessment
Verify the employee is responsible for:
- Managing the production planning process
- Managing the manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

### Performance Evaluation Criteria

**1. Production Planning Performance**
- Check for significant process changes during the review period
- Verify site coordination and administrative activity efficiency
- Rating: "good" if sites are well coordinated and activities are efficiently done

**2. Manufacturing Specifications Performance**

**Goal Setting Assessment**
- Determine if the employee defines "clear, concise, and specific goals"
- **Negative Indicators**:
  - Difficulty setting objectives and key results
  - "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews
  - Lack of definitive statement on system direction
- **Consequence**: Falling into the trap of "working on" things without reaching objectives

**Meeting Effectiveness Assessment**
- Determine if the employee confuses holding meetings with actual progress
- **Negative Indicator**: Satisfaction that having a meeting constitutes progress
- **Corrective Action**: Employee must define specific results to accomplish **prior** to each meeting

### Strengths & Background Utilization
- Evaluate speed of learning (e.g., getting up to speed quickly)
- Evaluate utilization of prior background to assist other areas voluntarily

### Promotion Eligibility Determination

**Current Status**: Promotion denied if specific criteria are not met

**Required Capabilities**:
- Must be able to take complex projects and show results
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of the way to achieve those goals

**Independence Requirement**:
- Employee must be the "primary driver"
- Supervisor helps only when needed
- Promotion is contingent on demonstrating capability for independent work

### Final Rating Determination

**"Meets Requirements"**: Assigned if capable of doing current job, but acknowledging specific areas need improvement

**Context Adjustment**: Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance

## Constraints
- Does not apply to non-exempt employees without modification
- Specific context (e.g., finance to manufacturing) is a key variable in evaluation
- Strict adherence to Potential Trap Rule (no exceptions for external factors)

## Output
- Corrected rating ensuring Manager Rating ≤ Organization Rating
- Performance Rating (Meets/Does Not Meet/Exceeds)
- Promotion Eligibility (Eligible/Not Eligible)
