# Detailed Examples for Each Need Level

## Physiological Needs Examples

- Dickens-era workers: Working solely to avoid starvation
- Entry-level employees accepting any job to pay rent
- Gig workers taking multiple jobs to cover basic expenses

## Safety/Security Needs Examples

- Employee prioritizing comprehensive medical insurance over higher salary
- Worker staying in stable job despite better offers elsewhere
- Individual building emergency fund before pursuing career advancement

## Social/Affiliation Needs Examples

- Employee accepting lower-paying job for team camaraderie
- "Misery loves company" - unhappy workers gravitating toward each other
- Excited, high-energy teams attracting similar personalities

## Esteem/Recognition Needs Examples

- Athlete greeting a top player (means everything to athlete, nothing to family)
- Professional seeking title promotion (VP, Director) for status
- "Keeping up with the Joneses" - comparing possessions/achievements to peers

## Self-Actualization Examples

- Scientist pursuing breakthrough research despite low pay
- Artist creating work for personal satisfaction, not commercial success
- Entrepreneur building company for vision, not just profit

## Limitation of Esteem Needs

Esteem needs are self-limiting:
- Once goal is reached (e.g., becoming VP), need loses urgency
- Motivation stops driving after achievement
- Requires new target or progression to self-actualization

## Cultural Considerations

- Individualistic cultures may emphasize esteem/self-actualization more
- Collectivist cultures may prioritize social needs higher
- Economic conditions can shift which needs are dominant
