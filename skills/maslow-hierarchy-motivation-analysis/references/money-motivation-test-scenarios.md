# Money Motivation Test - Detailed Scenarios

## Scenario A: Absolute Sum Focus
**Behavior**: Employee focuses on the actual dollar amount received.

**Interpretation**:
- Operating at Physiological or Safety level
- Money is a utilitarian resource
- Viewed as means to buy necessities or reach predetermined standard of living

**Real-World Example**:
Caribbean plant workers who quit immediately after reaching a specific savings goal. Once the monetary target was met, motivation ceased entirely.

**Management Implications**:
- Motivation is bounded
- Once need is satisfied, additional money has diminishing returns
- Focus on meeting the target, then shift to other motivators

## Scenario B: Relative Comparison Focus
**Behavior**: Employee focuses on how their raise compares to others' raises.

**Interpretation**:
- Operating at Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization level
- Money is a "measure of achievement"
- Viewed as scorecard for success

**Real-World Example**:
Venture Capitalists who continue working aggressively for wealth far beyond any practical need. The "second ten million" is just as important as the first because it signifies achievement.

**Management Implications**:
- Motivation is boundless
- Money serves as recognition and status symbol
- Competitive comparisons drive behavior
- Can sustain high motivation indefinitely

## Diagnostic Framework

| Reaction Focus | Motivation Level | Money View | Motivation Bound |
|----------------|------------------|------------|------------------|
| Absolute Sum | Physiological/Safety | Utilitarian Resource | Bounded (ceases when met) |
| Relative Comparison | Esteem/Self-Actualization | Measure of Achievement | Boundless |

## Application Notes
- Cultural differences in standard of living may affect "expected level" for physiological/safety needs
- Test is most effective when observing genuine reactions, not stated preferences
- Combine with behavioral observation for accuracy
- Consider career stage - early career may show physiological focus, later career may shift to esteem
