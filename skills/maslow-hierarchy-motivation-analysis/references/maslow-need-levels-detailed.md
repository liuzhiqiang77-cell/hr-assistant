## Esteem/Recognition Needs

**Driver**: Recognition from a specific reference group.

## Edge Cases

### Regressive Movement
If environment changes drastically (e.g., earthquake, crisis), individuals can regress instantly from satisfying high-level needs to fundamental survival needs.

### Concurrent Needs
People always have multiple needs active simultaneously. The key is identifying which is DOMINANT at any given time.
