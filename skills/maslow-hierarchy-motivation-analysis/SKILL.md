# Maslow's Hierarchy Motivation Analysis

## When to Use
- Analyzing human motivation drivers for individuals or teams
- Identifying specific motivators for an employee
- Diagnosing why an individual behaves a certain way
- Determining which needs are currently unsatisfied and driving behavior
- Using compensation reactions as a diagnostic tool

## Core Framework

### The Chain of Causality
Needs → Drives → Motivation

### Key Rules

1. **Satiation Rule**: A need once satisfied stops being a need and therefore stops being a source of motivation
2. **Maintenance Requirement**: To create and maintain high motivation, keep some needs unsatisfied at all times
3. **Dominance Principle**: One need is always stronger than others and largely determines motivation and performance
4. **Hierarchical Progression**: Needs progress from lower to higher (Physiological → Safety → Social → Esteem → Self-Actualization)
5. **Regressive Movement**: Drastic environmental changes can cause instant regression to fundamental needs

## Need Level Classification

### Physiological Needs
- **Definition**: Basic necessities of life (food, clothing) that money can buy
- **Driver**: Fear of deprivation (e.g., fear of starvation)

### Security/Safety Needs
- **Definition**: Desire to protect oneself from slipping back to deprivation
- **Driver**: Protection against catastrophic loss
- **Note**: Rarely dominant, but absence badly affects performance

### Social/Affiliation Needs
- **Definition**: Inherent desire to belong to a group with common traits
- **Driver**: Companionship and team identity

### Esteem/Recognition Needs
- **Definition**: Desire to keep up with or emulate a specific person or group
- **Driver**: Recognition from a specific reference group
- **Note**: Esteem exists in the eyes of the beholder; self-limiting once goal is reached

### Self-Actualization
- **Definition**: Need to achieve one's "utter personal best"
- **Characteristic**: Does not extinguish after fulfillment; drives to ever higher levels

## Diagnostic Tool: Money Motivation Hierarchy Test

### When to Apply
- Analyzing an employee's reaction to a raise or compensation change
- Determining whether money serves as utilitarian resource or achievement measure

### Execution Steps

1. **Assess Reaction to Salary Increase**
   - **Scenario A**: Individual focuses on the ABSOLUTE SUM of money received
   - **Scenario B**: Individual focuses on the RELATIVE COMPARISON against others

2. **Determine Motivation Mode**
   
   **If Scenario A (Absolute Sum)**:
   - Employee is motivated by Physiological or Safety needs
   - Money is a utilitarian resource to buy necessities
   - Motivation ceases once monetary target is met
   
   **If Scenario B (Relative Comparison)**:
   - Employee is motivated by Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization
   - Money is a "measure of achievement"
   - Motivation is boundless; each increment signifies achievement

3. **Interpret Result**
   - Lower levels: Money satisfies a deficit need
   - Upper levels: Money satisfies a growth need and serves as success scorecard

## Execution Steps for General Analysis

1. **Observe Behavior**: Identify what the individual is pursuing or avoiding
2. **Map to Need Level**: Classify the driver into one of the five levels
3. **Identify Dominant Need**: Determine which unsatisfied need is strongest
4. **Predict Behavior**: Use the dominant need to anticipate future actions
5. **Design Interventions**: Create environment that addresses or leverages the dominant need

## Key Constraints
- Needs are not strictly isolated; concurrent needs exist but one dominates
- Interpretation of needs is subjective (e.g., "esteem exists in the eyes of the beholder")
- Cultural differences may affect standard of living expectations
