# Interviewing Strategy and Reference Checking

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when you need to:
- Plan your interviewing strategy
- Check references for a candidate
- Conduct follow-up interviews
- Make a hiring decision based on comprehensive assessment

## Prerequisites
- Completed initial interview
- List of references

## Constraints
- High risk of failure
- No guarantee of success

## Strategic Principles

### Define the Ultimate Purpose
Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance. Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit.

### Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks
- Do not use tricks (e.g., three-legged chair) to test character
- Be completely straightforward; show yourself and the environment as they really are
- Rationale: A candidate is a potential employee. Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired.

## Reference Checking Protocol

### Goal
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.

### Build Rapport
- If you know the reference personally, you have a better chance of getting "real" information
- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

### Timing Strategy
The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond.

## Follow-up Interviews
If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references. Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks.

## Acknowledge Limitations
- Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- Accept that it merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well

## Output
Hiring decision based on comprehensive assessment and risk acknowledgment.
