# Training Curriculum Examples

## Example 1: Manufacturing Department Training Plan

**Department Statistics**:
- Total employees: 100
- Annual turnover: 15%
- Annual growth: 5%

**Task 1 Calculation**:
- Task 1 Load = 15% + 5% = 20%
- Must train 20 employees annually on basic skills

**Task 2 Calculation**:
- Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / 20% = 5x
- Training all 100 employees is 5x the effort of Task 1

**Curriculum**:
1. **New Hire Orientation** (Task 1): 40 hours, quarterly
2. **Safety Protocols** (Task 1): 16 hours, monthly
3. **Equipment Operation** (Task 1): 80 hours, as needed
4. **Quality Management** (Task 2): 24 hours, annual
5. **Process Improvement** (Task 2): 16 hours, annual

**Cost Analysis**:
- Task 1 cost: 20 employees × 136 hours = 2,720 hours
- Task 2 cost: 100 employees × 40 hours = 4,000 hours
- Total training hours: 6,720 hours
- Average per employee: 67.2 hours (3.4% of work time)

## Example 2: High-Leverage Training ROI

**Situation**: Manager wants to improve team's data analysis skills.

**Training Design**:
- Course: "Advanced Data Analysis for Operations"
- Duration: 8 hours (1 day)
- Preparation: 24 hours (3:1 ratio)
- Students: 15 team members
- Manager time: 32 hours

**Projected Impact**:
- Average student annual work hours: 2,000
- Total student hours: 30,000
- Expected efficiency gain: 2%
- Organizational gain: 600 hours

**ROI**: 600 hours gain / 32 hours investment = **18.75x**

**Decision**: Proceed with training—excellent ROI.

## Example 3: Cultural Alignment Check

**Company Culture**: "Free market"—employees apply for internal roles on their own initiative, minimal central coordination.

**Proposed Training**: "Structured Career Development Program" with 5-year career paths and coordinated rotations.

**Alignment Check**: ❌ **MISMATCH**

**Problem**: Training teaches structured career planning, but company practices free-market self-direction.

**Consequence**: Participants will be frustrated when they return to work and cannot apply what they learned.

**Corrected Training**: "Self-Directed Career Development" focused on:
- Identifying personal strengths
- Networking skills
- Internal job application strategies
- Building personal brand

**Alignment Check**: ✅ **ALIGNED**

## Example 4: Training as Process vs. Event

**Wrong Approach (Event)**:
- Problem: Customer complaints increasing
- Reaction: Schedule one-day "Customer Service Excellence" training
- Result: Temporary improvement, complaints return in 2 months

**Correct Approach (Process)**:
- Problem: Customer complaints increasing
- Analysis: Root cause is inconsistent follow-up procedures
- Solution: 
  1. Month 1: "Customer Follow-Up Fundamentals" (4 hours)
  2. Month 2: Case study review session (2 hours)
  3. Month 3: Role-playing practice (2 hours)
  4. Month 4: Progress review and advanced techniques (2 hours)
  5. Ongoing: Monthly 1-hour refresher and Q&A
- Result: Sustained improvement, new habits formed
