# Managerial Training Strategy

This skill helps managers design and execute effective training programs that deliver high return on investment.

## When to Use
- Subordinates lack specific skills or capability
- New employees join the organization
- New organizational skills, principles, or methods are required
- You need to increase organizational output through capability development

## Core Principles

### Manager's Output Definition
A manager's output is strictly defined as **"the output of his organization—no more, no less."**

### Performance Levers
To increase individual performance, utilize two principal means:
1. Increasing motivation (desire to do the job well)
2. Increasing individual capability (via training)

**Key Insight**: Just as motivation cannot be fully delegated, neither should training be delegated solely to specialists.

## High-Leverage Training ROI Calculation

### The Preparation Ratio
Allocate **3 hours of preparation for every 1 hour of course time**.

### ROI Example

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Preparation | 12 hours (4 lectures × 3 hours prep) |
| Course Time | 4 hours |
| Total Manager Time | 16 hours |
| Students | 10 |
| Annual Student Work Hours | 20,000 hours |
| Performance Improvement | 1% |
| **Organizational Gain** | **200 hours** |
| **ROI** | **12.5x** (200 hours gain / 16 hours investment) |

### Risk of Insufficient Training
Failure to train employees leads to:
- Inefficiencies
- Excess costs
- Unhappy customers
- Danger

**Example**: An untrained operator operating an ion implanter caused >$1M in scrapped material and delivery slips.

## Training Strategy Framework

### Step 1: Assign the Trainer Role

**The manager (you) must instruct direct subordinates and the next few ranks below them.**

**Rationale**: Training must be performed by a "suitable role model" who is a "believable, practicing authority."

**Constraint**: Proxies, regardless of subject matter expertise, cannot fill this role effectively.

### Step 2: Establish Curriculum Scope

**Benchmark**: Maintain a catalogue of courses (e.g., Intel's "university catalogue" with 50+ classes).

**Course Categories**:
- Basic skills (e.g., telephone manners)
- Complex technical skills (e.g., ion implanter operation requiring ~200 hours)
- Management disciplines (e.g., strategic planning, "constructive confrontation", performance reviews, productive meetings)

**Time Allocation**: Approximately **2% to 4% of employee time** to classroom learning.

### Step 3: Classify the Training Task

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Task 1: New Member Training | Teaching new members the skills needed to perform their jobs |
| Task 2: New Skill Training | Teaching new ideas, principles, or skills to present members |

### Step 4: Calculate Training Volume for Task 1 (New Members)

**Formula**:
```
Annual Training Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)
```

**Example**:
- Annual Turnover Rate: 10%
- Annual Growth Rate: 10%
- **Task 1 Load: 20%** (must train 20% of staff annually)

### Step 5: Calculate Training Volume for Task 2 (New Skills)

**Target**: 100% of the staff.

**Comparison Formula**:
```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

**Example**:
- Task 1 Load: 20%
- **Task 2 Magnitude: 5x** (training all staff is 5 times larger than training new staff)

### Step 6: Evaluate Cost and Feasibility

**Cost Calculation**: Based on student time.

**Benchmark**: A one-day course for middle-management staff can cost over **$1,000,000** in student time alone.

**Decision Rule**: Do not enter into Task 2 (training all staff) lightly due to high magnitude and cost.

## Cultural Alignment

### Ensure Training Matches Practice

**Do NOT**:
- Use "highly structured and academic" approaches if they contradict company practices
- Teach "carefully coordinated job rotations" if company tradition is "free market" where employees apply for jobs on their own initiative

**Consequence of Mismatch**: Teaching and practice contradiction demoralizes participants.

### Maintain Consistency

**Training must be a "process, not an event."**

**Do**:
- Provide a "reliable, consistent presence"
- Make training "systematic and scheduled"

**Do NOT**:
- Use training as a "rescue effort summoned to solve the problem of the moment"
