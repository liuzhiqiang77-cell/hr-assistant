# Operation Review Conduct

Facilitate cross-level teaching and learning through structured reviews with clearly defined roles.

## Purpose

Provide medium for interaction between employees several organizational levels apart who lack:
- Regular one-on-one meetings
- Routine staff meetings

**Motivation**: Presenters have opportunity to impress supervisors' supervisors and peers.

## Role Responsibilities

### Organizing Manager (Supervisor)

1. **Decide content**: What issues to discuss, emphasize, and level of detail
2. **Handle housekeeping**: Room arrangements, visuals, invitations
3. **Act as timekeeper**:
   - Schedule presentations
   - Keep them moving using inconspicuous gestures
   - Prevent running out of time

### Reviewing Manager (Senior Supervisor)

1. **Ask questions, make comments, impart appropriate spirit**
2. **Act as catalyst**:
   - Provoke audience participation
   - Encourage free expression by example
3. **NEVER preview the material**—ensures spontaneous reaction
4. **Take role seriously**—model for junior managers

### Presenters

1. **Use visual aids** (overhead transparencies, slides) to engage eyes and ears simultaneously
2. **Follow Rule of Thumb**: Allow **4 minutes** per visual aid (tables, numbers, graphics)
3. **Highlight emphasis** using color pen or pointer
4. **Monitor audience "like a hawk"**:
   - Watch facial expressions
   - Watch body language
   - Adjust speed or clarify points based on feedback

### Audience

1. **Participate actively**:
   - Ask questions
   - Make comments
2. **Avoid disengagement behaviors**:
   - Avoiding eye contact
   - Yawning
   - Reading newspaper/smartphone
   - These behaviors undermine presenter confidence
3. **Correct factual errors publicly**—it is your responsibility
4. **Regard attendance as work**, not a "siesta"

## Key Constraints

- **Not for**: Immediate supervisor-subordinate one-on-ones
- **Not for**: Routine staff meetings
- **Only for**: Cross-level teaching/learning requiring formal structure
