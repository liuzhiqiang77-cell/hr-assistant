# Visual Aid Guidelines

## Types of Visual Aids

### Tables
- Use for numerical data
- Keep simple and readable
- Highlight key figures with color

### Numbers
- Display large enough to read from back of room
- Round to meaningful precision
- Use consistent formatting

### Graphics
- Charts, graphs, diagrams
- Label axes clearly
- Use color to differentiate data series
- Include legends when needed

## Presentation Techniques

### Highlighting Emphasis
- Use color pen to point to key items
- Use pointer for direct attention
- Circle or underline important figures
- Use arrows to show relationships

### Engagement Tips
- Face the audience, not the screen
- Use gestures to reference visual elements
- Pause after showing complex information
- Check for understanding before moving on

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Too much text on one slide
- Small fonts (< 18pt recommended)
- Cluttered layouts
- Reading directly from the visual
- Turning back to audience for extended periods

## Time Allocation Examples

|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| 5           | 20 minutes   | 25-30 minutes    |
| 10          | 40 minutes   | 45-50 minutes    |
| 15          | 60 minutes   | 65-75 minutes    |
| 20          | 80 minutes   | 90-100 minutes   |

Note: Add buffer time for transitions and questions.
