# Operation Review Time Planning

## The Rule of Thumb

**4 minutes of presentation and discussion time per visual aid**

## Calculation Examples

| Visual Aids | Presentation Time |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 5 | 20 minutes |
| 10 | 40 minutes |
| 15 | 60 minutes |
| 20 | 80 minutes |

## What Counts as a Visual Aid?

- Overhead transparencies
- Presentation slides
- Data tables
- Charts and graphs
- Any graphic requiring audience visual attention

## Time Allocation Components

The 4 minutes per visual typically includes:
- 2 minutes: Presenter explanation
- 1-2 minutes: Audience questions/discussion
- Buffer: Transition between visuals

## Planning Recommendations

### For Presenters
- Count your visual aids BEFORE the meeting
- Calculate total time needed
- Inform organizer of time requirement
- Prepare to adjust speed if running behind

### For Organizing Manager
- Allocate time blocks based on visual count
- Build in buffer between presenters
- Use inconspicuous signals for time warnings
  - 5 minutes remaining: Hold up 5 fingers
  - 2 minutes remaining: Hold up 2 fingers
  - Wrap up: Tapping watch or pen

### For Reviewing Manager
- Monitor engagement to ensure time is productive
- If discussion runs long, politely redirect: "Let's capture that for follow-up so we can cover the remaining material."
