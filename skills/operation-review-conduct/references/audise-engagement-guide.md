# Audience Engagement in Operation Reviews

## Engagement Dos

### Active Participation
- **Ask relevant questions** about data or conclusions
- **Share insights** from your experience
- **Connect** to broader organizational context
- **Clarify** points that are unclear

### Constructive Feedback
- **Correct errors** when you spot them (it's your responsibility)
- **Challenge assumptions** respectfully
- **Suggest alternatives** with data to back them up
- **Praise good work** publicly

### Physical Presence
- **Maintain eye contact** with presenter
- **Take notes** to stay engaged
- **Nod or acknowledge** when you understand points
- **Lean forward** to show interest

## Engagement Don'ts

### Behaviors That Undermine Confidence
- **Avoid eye contact**—signals disinterest
- **Yawn**—signals boredom (even if you're tired)
- **Read unrelated material** (newspaper, phone, laptop)
- **Side conversations**—distracts from presenter
- **Check watch repeatedly**—signals impatience

### Mental States to Avoid
- **Siesta mode**: Treating attendance as rest time
- **Spectator mode**: Passive consumption only
- **Critic mode**: Finding fault without helping
- **Expert mode**: Already knowing everything (no learning)

## When to Correct Publicly

### Do Correct Publicly When:
- **Factual errors** in data or calculations
- **Misrepresentations** of other departments' work
- **Technical inaccuracies** that could mislead decisions
- **Attribution errors** (wrongly credited contributions)

### Handle Privately When:
- **Style/presentation issues** (cluttered slides, speaking pace)
- **Personal matters** (dress, hygiene)
- **Opinions** you disagree with but aren't factually wrong
- **Minor issues** that don't impact core message

## Correcting Errors Effectively

### Sample Scripts

**For data error:**
> "Excuse me—on that chart, I think the Q3 numbers are off by about 10%. Let me double-check, but I believe it should be 42, not 38."

**For technical inaccuracy:**
> "That's an interesting conclusion. My understanding is that the process actually works differently because of X. Can you walk me through your reasoning?"

**For attribution error:**
> "Actually, that idea came from the engineering team, not marketing. They should get credit for that insight."

### Principles for Public Correction
1. **Be respectful** of the presenter
2. **Be certain** of your correction (or frame as question)
3. **Focus on the work**, not the person
4. **Allow presenter** to clarify or respond
5. **Move forward** after correction is acknowledged
