# Candidate Interview Questioning

## When to Use
- When you are in an active interview session with a job candidate
- When you need to assess a candidate's technical skills, operational values, and problem-solving abilities
- When you want to determine a candidate's readiness for a new position

## Interview Questioning Process

### 1. Ask Recommended Core Questions

Ask these specific questions to assess different aspects of the candidate:

- **Projects and Recognition:** "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- **Weaknesses:** "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
- **Value Proposition:** "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- **Problem Solving:** "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
- **Readiness:** "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"
- **Achievements:** "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

### 2. Categorize Your Inquiries

Ensure comprehensive coverage by tracking inquiry categories:

- **Technical/Skills:** Projects, weaknesses assessment
- **Application of Knowledge:** Past achievements, past failures and what was learned
- **Discrepancies:** Learning from failures, problems encountered in current role
- **Operational Values:** Readiness for new position, why the company should hire them

### 3. Utilize Direct Questions

- Ask blunt, direct questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?")
- Observe the candidate's reaction carefully
- Gauge confidence vs. timidity in responses
- Direct reactions often reveal actual capability more than rehearsed answers

### 4. Employ Hypothetical Situations

- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps)
- Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result (e.g., finished cost of a wafer)
- Observe their problem-solving capacity in real-time
- Assess their ability to derive principles on the fly

### 5. Invite Candidate Questions

- Ask: "What would you like to know about me, the company, or the job?"
- Analyze their questions to determine:
  - What they already know about the role/company
  - What they value in a position
  - How prepared they are for the interview

## Output
The result of this skill is a comprehensive assessment of the candidate's skills, values, problem-solving capacity, and potential fit for the role.
