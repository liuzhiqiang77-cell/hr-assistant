# The Peter Principle

## Understanding the Principle

The Peter Principle states: **In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to their level of incompetence.**

### How It Manifests

**1. Selection Based on Current Performance**
- Selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role
- Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"

**2. Continued Promotion Until Failure**
- Because promotion is based on current success, the employee continues to be promoted
- Promotion continues until they reach a role they are not skilled for

**3. Final State: Incompetence Level**
- The employee stops being promoted once they are no longer competent
- They remain in that role indefinitely
- Result: "Managers rise to the level of their incompetence"

## Root Cause

The fundamental error is assuming that:
- Skills required in the current role = Skills required in the next role
- Success as an individual contributor = Success as a manager
- Success at one management level = Success at the next management level

## When to Apply This Principle

- Designing or reviewing promotion systems
- Evaluating candidates for new roles
- Assessing why managers are struggling
- Analyzing organizational competence distribution
- Planning career development paths
- Diagnosing performance issues at higher levels
- Identifying training needs before promotion

## Mitigation Strategies

### Assess Intended Role Requirements

Instead of looking only at current performance:
- Define competencies required for the intended role
- Assess candidate against those specific competencies
- Recognize that different roles require different skills

### Skills Gap Analysis

- Identify gaps between current role skills and intended role skills
- Provide training to bridge gaps before promotion
- Test competencies through trials or projects
- Use assessment centers or simulations

### Separate Performance Tracks

- Create dual career paths (individual contributor and management)
- Allow advancement without management responsibility
- Recognize that not everyone should manage
- Value specialist expertise equally with general management

### Probationary Periods

- Use trial periods for new roles
- Provide feedback and support early
- Revert to previous role if not working out
- Remove stigma from "not a fit" for management

### Selection Criteria Changes

- Base selection on potential for the new role, not just success in the old role
- Use validated assessment methods
- Include input from those who have succeeded in the target role
- Consider multiple candidates through competitive evaluation

## Key Constraints

- Does NOT apply if selection is based on competencies specific to the intended role
- Does NOT apply if skills required for the new role are identical to the current role
- Does NOT apply if proper assessment and development processes are in place
- Does NOT mean all promoted employees are incompetent—only those promoted without proper assessment

## Recognizing Peter Principle Situations

**Signs in Organizations**
- High performers promoted until they fail
- Good individual contributors become poor managers
- Managers struggle in their roles despite strong past performance
- Organizational layers filled with marginally competent people
- Difficulty finding good candidates for higher roles

**Signs in Individuals**
- Was excellent in previous role but struggling now
- Lacks skills obviously needed for current role
- Cannot adapt to the demands of the new position
- Reluctance to admit difficulties or seek help
- Organizational reluctance to address the mismatch
