# Performer Type Review Processes

## When to Use
- Conducting reviews for high achievers who need development guidance
- Managing subordinates with major performance problems requiring turnaround
- An employee is at risk of termination unless performance improves

## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process (Poor Performers)

### Identify the Resistance Cycle Stages
1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation

### Facilitate Progression Through Stages
- Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality (Ignore → Deny)
- Use evidence to overcome resistance (Deny → Blame Others)
- Guide the subordinate to take the "biggest step" of Assuming Responsibility
- Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task

### Possible Outcomes
1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')
1. Assume the formal role of supervisor with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. Secure the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### Analyze Current Review Content
- Identify if the review is purely a "retrospective assessment"
- Check if the review focuses only on justifying a high rating

### Recognize the Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying the judgment of superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better.

### Contrast with Poor Performers
- Poor performers often receive detailed "corrective action programs"
- High achievers often lack future-oriented guidance

### Shift the Priority
Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to:
- Improve performance
- Maintain their current high level

### Rationale
High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a "high-leverage activity" where the impact on group output is very great.
