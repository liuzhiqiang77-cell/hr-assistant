## Time Offset Examples

### Example 1: R&D Lead
**Situation**: Manager spent year setting up new research facility from scratch. No products shipped yet.
**Time Offset**: 2-3 years before results visible
**Activities**: Secured funding, built team, established processes, initiated projects
**Assessment**: Strong performance based on activities. Credit given for building future capacity.

### Example 2: Process Improvement Engineer
**Situation**: Improved manufacturing design methods that will reduce defects by 30% next year. Current output: lower defect rate not yet achieved.
**Time Offset**: Results will appear in next review period
**Activities**: Redesigned processes, trained teams, implemented new systems
**Present Value**: Future 30% defect reduction worth significant savings today
**Assessment**: Strong performance for future-oriented work

### Example 3: Production Manager
**Situation**: Met all schedules and quotas this year.
**Time Offset**: Immediate
**Activities**: Maintained existing processes
**Assessment**: Meets requirements, but no long-term contribution

## Potential Trap Examples

### Example 1: Failing Business Unit Manager
**Situation**: Division lost $5M, missed revenue forecast by 40%. Manager is charismatic, knowledgeable, well-liked.
**Form/Potential**: Looks like a great manager, excellent presenter
**Substance**: Organization failed
**Rating Constraint**: Manager rating must be "Does Not Meet Requirements" or similar poor rating
**Rejected Excuse**: "Manager is outstanding despite organization failure"

### Example 2: Startup Division Manager
**Situation**: New division lost money as expected during ramp-up. Manager built strong team, achieved key milestones.
**Organization Rating**: Consider context—may be "Meets Requirements" if losses were planned and milestones met
**Manager Rating**: Can match organization rating if milestones achieved
**Key**: Organization rating must consider context, but manager still cannot exceed it
