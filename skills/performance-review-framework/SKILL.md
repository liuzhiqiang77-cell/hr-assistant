# Performance Review Framework

Apply the fundamental principles, time offset analysis, and rating constraints to ensure fair and accurate performance evaluations.

## When to Use
- Conducting performance reviews for subordinates
- Determining manager performance ratings
- Evaluating work where results lag behind activities
- Assessing long-term vs short-term contributions
- Reviewing managers whose organizations performed poorly

## Fundamental Purpose of Performance Reviews

The primary goal is to **improve the subordinate's performance**. Secondary purposes include rewards, discipline, feedback, and administrative functions.

### Focus Areas

1. **Skill Level**
   - Determine what skills are missing
   - Find ways to remedy skill gaps

2. **Motivation Level**
   - Intensify the subordinate's motivation
   - Aim to move subordinate to a higher performance curve for the same skill level

## Time Offset and Long-Term Assessment

Analyze performance when current output reflects past activities:

### Analyze Time Offset
- Determine if output in the review period is linked to activities in the same period
- Recognize that current output may be "light from distant stars" (reflecting work done years ago)

### Judge Performance Based on Activities
- If tangible output is absent but activities were strong, give credit for performance
- Do not penalize for lack of immediate output if building future capacity

### Weigh Long-Term vs Short-Term
- Evaluate immediate outputs against future-oriented activities
- Apply "Present Value" concept: estimate future payback and determine current worth

## The Potential Trap Rule

Enforce the critical constraint that a manager's rating cannot exceed their organization's rating.

### Assess Substance Over Form
- Evaluate actual performance and real output
- Ignore "potential" defined as form (knowledge, handling oneself well, looking like a manager)

### Apply the Organization Cap
- **RULE**: Manager performance rating ≤ Organization rating
- Compare manager's rating to organization's rating derived from output and internal measures

### Enforce Consequences
- If business unit lost money, missed forecasts, slipped schedules, or showed poor internal measures, manager cannot receive high rating
- Reject excuses that organization failed but manager is "outstanding"
- Prevent negative signaling that "acting" like a manager is sufficient

## Key Principles
- Performance improvement is the primary purpose
- Credit activities that build future capacity
- Manager ratings are capped by organizational performance
- Focus on substance (results) over form (potential)
