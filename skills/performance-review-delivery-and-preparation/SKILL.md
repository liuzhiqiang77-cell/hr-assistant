# Performance Review Delivery and Preparation

## When to Use
- When preparing for a performance review
- When delivering a performance assessment to a subordinate
- When handling a mixed positive/negative review
- When managing a poor performer requiring turnaround
- When developing a high achiever
- When ensuring review integrity and proper protocols

## Fundamental Purpose of Performance Reviews

### Primary Goal
Improve the subordinate's performance. While reviews serve multiple functions (rewards, discipline, feedback), the primary goal is performance improvement.

### Focus Areas
1. **Skill Level**: Determine what skills are missing and find ways to remedy the lack
2. **Motivation**: Intensify the subordinate's motivation to move them to a "higher performance curve"

### Secondary Purposes
Acknowledge other valid reasons but prioritize performance improvement:
- Assessing work
- Motivating
- Providing feedback
- Justifying raises
- Rewarding
- Discipline
- Direction
- Reinforcing culture

## Review Preparation for Mixed Assessments

### Data Scanning
Review all available material including progress reports, performance against quarterly objectives, and one-on-one meeting notes.

### Brainstorming (The Worksheet)
1. Sit with a blank piece of paper
2. Write "everything down" regarding the subordinate's performance
3. Do not edit in your head; include things major, minor, and trivial in no particular order
4. Understand that writing items down does not commit you to doing anything

### Documentation Removal
Once you run out of items, put all supporting documentation away.

### Relationship Analysis
Look for relationships between items on the worksheet. Identify if items are different manifestations of the same phenomenon or indications of why strengths/weaknesses exist.

### Message Formulation
Convert identified relationships into "messages" for the subordinate.

### Evidence Gathering
From the worksheet, draw conclusions and specific examples to support them.

### Filtering
Ask yourself if the subordinate will be able to remember all the messages chosen. If not, delete the less important ones. Excluded items can be taken up in the next review.

### Handling Surprises
If the worksheet reveals a message that "startles you," you must deliver it to improve performance. Swallow hard and bring it up.

## The Three L's of Assessment Delivery

### Level
Be totally frank with your subordinate. The credibility and integrity of the entire system depend on your being totally frank. Praise someone in a straightforward fashion can be just as hard as criticizing without embarrassment.

### Listen
Employ your entire arsenal of sensory capabilities to ensure points are interpreted by the subordinate's brain.

**Goal**: Transmit thoughts from your brain to theirs; words are just the means, getting the right thought communicated is the end.

**Identify Barriers**: Watch for signs that the subordinate is:
- Too emotional to understand clear points
- Preoccupied trying to formulate answers rather than listening
- Tuned out as a defense mechanism

**Verification Techniques**:
- Watch the person you are talking to
- Check for appropriate verbal and nonverbal responses
- Check if they allow themselves to receive your message

**Responsibility**: If responses do not completely assure you that the message has gotten through, keep at it until you are satisfied. If not understood, explain things again or in a different way.

### Leave Yourself Out
Ensure the review focuses solely on the subordinate. Keep your own insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or other emotions out of it. At issue are the subordinate's problems; it is the subordinate's day in court.

## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process

### Identify the Resistance Cycle
Track the subordinate's current stage:
1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation

### Facilitate Progression
- Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality (Ignore → Deny)
- Use evidence to overcome resistance (Deny → Blame Others)
- Guide the subordinate to Assume Responsibility (the biggest step)
- Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task

### Possible Outcomes
1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (If stuck at 'Blame Others')
1. Assume the formal role of the supervisor endowed with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. Secure the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### Analyze Current Review Content
Determine if the review is purely a retrospective assessment or focused on justifying a high rating.

### Recognize the Common Pitfall
Supervisors often spend effort justifying the judgment of superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better.

### Contrast with Poor Performers
Poor performers often receive detailed corrective action programs, whereas high achievers often lack future-oriented guidance.

### Shift the Priority
Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to improve performance or maintain their current level.

### Rationale
High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a high-leverage activity where the impact on group output is very great.

## Review Integrity and Delivery Protocols

### Handling Self-Reviews
- Do not ask for a self-review if you intend to simply change the format, retype it, and hand it back
- If you rely on the subordinate to tell you their accomplishments, you appear unaware and the subordinate feels cheated
- Preserve the integrity of your judgment by making an upfront assessment without being prompted

### Handling Upward Feedback
- You may ask the subordinate to evaluate your performance as a supervisor
- Clearly state that their assessment has only "advisory status"
- Never pretend you and subordinates are equals; you are the leader

### Timing of Written Review Delivery
**Recommended Approach**: Ensure the subordinate has time to work out their reactions to the review content before the discussion to ensure a "good meeting of minds."

**Option A: During Discussion (Not Recommended)**
- Risk: Subordinate reads ahead instead of listening
- Risk: Subordinate cannot stop reading to discuss
- Risk: Subordinate has no time to think

**Option B: After Discussion (Not Recommended)**
- Risk: Subordinate may find a phrase they didn't "hear" earlier and react negatively

### Enforcing Quality
If a review is superficial, lacks analysis, or lacks depth, insist on a rewrite. The integrity of the performance review system is more important than the subordinate's preference to not spend time on it.
