# Performance Intervention Strategies

Handle major performance problems through the "Blast" review process and develop high achievers by shifting from retrospective assessment to future-oriented improvement planning.

## When to Use
- Subordinate has major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing
- Conducting review for a high achiever
- Employee is stuck in denial or blame regarding performance issues
- High performer review focuses only on past justification rather than future growth

## The "Blast" Performance Review Process

Use when a subordinate's job is at risk unless performance improves dramatically.

### Identify the Resistance Stage
Track which stage the subordinate is currently in:

| Stage | Description | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1. Ignore | Passive ignoring of the problem | Pretends issue doesn't exist |
| 2. Deny | Active denial | Claims problem is not real |
| 3. Blame Others | Admits problem but avoids responsibility | "Not my fault" |
| 4. Assume Responsibility | Admits "It is my problem" | Emotional breakthrough |
| 5. Find Solution | Intellectual step to remedy | Ready to solve together |

### Facilitate Stage Progression

**From Ignore → Deny**:
- Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality

**From Deny → Blame Others**:
- Use evidence to overcome resistance

**From Blame Others → Assume Responsibility** (CRITICAL STEP):
- This is the **biggest step**—an **emotional** step, not intellectual
- Subordinate realizes: "If it's my problem, I have to do something about it"
- This implies work and unpleasantness—guide them through it

**From Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**:
- Once responsibility is assumed, finding solutions is a **shared task** and **relatively easier** (intellectual step)

### Possible Outcomes

1. **Best**: Subordinate accepts assessment AND recommended cure
2. **Acceptable**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment but commits to cure
3. **Unacceptable**: Subordinate disagrees and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (Stuck at "Blame Others")

If subordinate refuses to assume responsibility:

1. **Assume formal role**: State you are the supervisor endowed with position power

2. **State instruction clearly**:
   > "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."

3. **Acknowledge disagreement**:
   > "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."

4. **Assert organizational requirement**:
   > "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."

5. **Secure commitment** and monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### The Problem
Supervisors often spend effort justifying ratings for high achievers while giving little attention to how they could do even better. Poor performers often receive detailed "corrective action programs" while high achievers lack future-oriented guidance.

### Key Principle
High achievers account for a **disproportionately large share** of work. Improving them is a **high-leverage activity** with great impact on group output.

### Development Process

**1. Analyze Current Review Content**
- Is the review purely a "retrospective assessment"?
- Is it focused only on justifying a high rating?

**2. Contrast with Poor Performers**
- Poor performers receive detailed corrective action programs
- High achievers often receive only past-focused justification

**3. Shift the Priority**
Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to:
- Improve performance beyond current level, OR
- Maintain current level at higher effectiveness

**4. High-Leverage Focus**
Remember: Small improvements in high achievers yield large organizational gains

### High Achiever Review Checklist
- [ ] Review includes future-oriented actions, not just past justification
- [ ] Specific steps defined for next-level performance
- [ ] Development opportunities identified
- [ ] Leverage principle applied: focus on high-impact improvements
- [ ] Avoid the trap of retrospective-only assessment

## Decision Framework

| Situation | Use Strategy |
|-----------|--------------|
| Major performance problem, job at risk | Blast Review Process |
| High performer needs development | High Achiever Development |
| Minor performance issues | Standard coaching + Can't/Won't diagnosis |
| Average performer meeting requirements | Standard review + future goals |
