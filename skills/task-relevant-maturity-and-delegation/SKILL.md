# Task-Relevant Maturity and Delegation

Effective delegation requires shared operational values, accurate assessment of subordinate capability, and appropriate monitoring. This skill provides the complete workflow.

## Establish Shared Operational Values

Before delegating, ensure you and your subordinate share common operational values, priorities, and preferences.

**Key Principles:**
- The supervisor is accountable for subordinate output
- Transmit common values and teach the subordinate early
- Never allow subordinates to "pay tuition" via customer-impacting mistakes
- As TRM grows, structure moves from externally imposed to internally adopted

**When to Apply:**
- Before delegating any significant task
- When onboarding new subordinates
- When a subordinate's performance indicates misalignment

## Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

TRM is specific to the task, not general competence. A person can have high TRM in one job and low TRM in another.

**TRM Components:**
1. Achievement orientation (drive to achieve)
2. Readiness to take responsibility
3. Education, training, and experience specific to the task

**Assessment Factors:**
- TRM can drop if the job pace accelerates or the job abruptly changes
- Even seasoned managers have low TRM in new environments
- TRM can change day by day or hour by hour

**Classification:**
- **Low TRM:** New to task, environment, or pace
- **Medium/Growing TRM:** Gaining experience and confidence
- **High TRM:** Experienced and ready for autonomy

## Delegate Effectively

**Prerequisites:**
- Common information base between delegator and delegatee
- Shared operational values

**Delegation Rules:**
1. **Avoid insincere delegation:** Don't emotionally hold onto tasks while pretending to delegate
2. **Delegate familiar tasks:** When given a choice, delegate activities you know best (easier to monitor)
3. **Retain responsibility:** "Delegation without follow-through is abdication"—you remain accountable for the outcome

**When Delegation Fails:**
- No common information base (requires specific instructions, yields low leverage)
- Insincere delegation (the "pencil experiment")

## Monitor Based on TRM

Monitoring ensures work proceeds in line with expectations without becoming meddling.

**Quality Assurance Principles:**
1. **Monitor at the lowest-added-value stage:** Review rough drafts early, not final polished versions
2. **Use sampling:** Don't check 100% of details; check randomly to ensure satisfactory progress

**Adjust Frequency by TRM:**
- **Low TRM:** Increase monitoring frequency (newly delegated tasks)
- **Medium TRM:** Moderate monitoring
- **High TRM:** Decrease intensity as performance improves

**Avoid Meddling:**
- Monitoring focuses on outcomes and progress
- Meddling prescribes specific activities
- Let the subordinate determine the "how" while you ensure the "what"

## Workflow Summary

1. Establish shared operational values
2. Assess TRM for the specific task
3. Select appropriate task to delegate (prefer familiar tasks)
4. Delegate with clear expectations
5. Monitor at lowest-added-value stage
6. Adjust monitoring frequency based on TRM growth
7. Retain accountability for the outcome
