# TRM Assessment Examples

## High TRM in One Area, Low in Another

A senior marketing manager with 10 years of experience:
- **High TRM:** Launching traditional print campaigns (familiar territory)
- **Low TRM:** Managing social media crisis response (new environment, rapid pace)

## TRM Changes Over Time

A software engineer transitioning to management:
- **Initial State:** High TRM in coding, Low TRM in people management
- **After 3 months:** Medium TRM in people management (gaining experience)
- **After 1 year:** High TRM in people management (proven track record)

## TRM Drops Due to Environmental Change

An experienced salesperson:
- **Normal State:** High TRM in B2B sales
- **After company pivot to B2C:** Low TRM (different customer psychology, sales cycle)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The "Customer Tuition" Anti-Pattern

**Scenario:** A new customer service representative is allowed to learn by making mistakes.

**Result:** Customers pay for the learning through poor service, frustration, and potential churn.

**Correct Approach:** The supervisor teaches correct operational values and procedures before the subordinate interacts with customers.

### The "Pencil Experiment" Anti-Pattern

**Scenario:** A manager delegates a task but keeps the pencil (metaphorically), constantly checking in and re-doing work.

**Result:** The subordinate feels micromanaged and disempowered; the manager hasn't actually delegated.

**Correct Approach:** Either genuinely delegate (with appropriate monitoring) or consciously keep the task because you enjoy it.
