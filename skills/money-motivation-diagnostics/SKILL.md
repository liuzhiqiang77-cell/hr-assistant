# Money Motivation Diagnostics

## When to Use
- Analyzing an employee's reaction to a raise or compensation change
- Determining why monetary incentives are ineffective
- Designing compensation packages for specific individuals
- Understanding motivation level through compensation lens
- Venture capital or high-stakes compensation scenarios

## Prerequisites
- Observation of employee behavior regarding compensation
- Knowledge of salary changes or compensation structure
- Understanding of Maslow's hierarchy of needs

## Diagnostic Procedure

### Step 1: Present Compensation Change
- Implement a salary increase or compensation change
- Ensure the change is significant enough to elicit a reaction

### Step 2: Observe Reaction Focus
Assess which aspect of the compensation the employee focuses on:

**Scenario A: Absolute Sum Focus**
- Employee focuses on the absolute amount of money received
- Questions: "How much more am I getting?" "What's the total?"
- Behavior: Satisfaction tied to reaching a specific monetary target

**Scenario B: Relative Comparison Focus**
- Employee focuses on how their raise compares to others
- Questions: "How does this compare to peers?" "Am I at the top?"
- Behavior: Satisfaction tied to relative ranking or status

### Step 3: Determine Motivation Mode

#### If Scenario A (Absolute Sum)
**Motivation Level**: Physiological or Safety Needs
- **Reasoning**: Money is viewed as a utilitarian resource
- **Purpose**: Buy necessities or reach predetermined standard of living
- **Limitation**: Motivation ceases once monetary target is met
- **Example**: Caribbean plant workers quitting after reaching savings goal

#### If Scenario B (Relative Comparison)
**Motivation Level**: Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization
- **Reasoning**: Money is viewed as a "measure of achievement"
- **Purpose**: Scorecard for success, recognition of capability
- **Characteristic**: Motivation is boundless
- **Example**: Venture Capitalists where "the second ten million is just as important as the first"

### Step 4: Apply Management Strategy

#### For Lower-Level Motivation (Physiological/Safety)
- Money satisfies a deficit need
- Once need is met, additional money has diminishing returns
- Strategy: Provide sufficient compensation to meet needs, then shift to non-monetary motivators

#### For Upper-Level Motivation (Esteem/Self-Actualization)
- Money satisfies a growth need
- Serves as ongoing scorecard for achievement
- Strategy: Use compensation as recognition and achievement signal; can continue to motivate

## Output
Classification of the employee's motivation mode and appropriate compensation strategy.

## Variables
- **reaction_focus**: Absolute amount or Relative ranking
- **motivation_mode**: Physiological/Safety (deficit) or Esteem/Self-Actualization (growth)
