# Money Motivation Diagnostic Examples

## Example 1: Factory Worker (Physiological/Safety Mode)

### Scenario
- Worker receives $2/hour raise
- Reaction: "Great! Now I can afford a better apartment and save for a car"
- Focus: Absolute sum and what it can purchase

### Diagnosis
- **Mode**: Physiological/Safety needs
- **Money Role**: Utilitarian resource for necessities
- **Motivation Pattern**: Will work hard until financial goal reached, then motivation drops

### Management Strategy
- Set clear compensation targets
- Once target reached, introduce non-monetary motivators

## Example 2: Sales Manager (Esteem Mode)

### Scenario
- Manager receives $10,000 bonus
- Reaction: "Is this more than what the other regional managers got?"
- Focus: Relative comparison and status

### Diagnosis
- **Mode**: Esteem/Recognition needs
- **Money Role**: Measure of achievement and status relative to peers
- **Motivation Pattern**: Will continue to be motivated by higher compensation as status symbol

### Management Strategy
- Use compensation as recognition signal
- Publicize achievement associated with compensation

## Example 3: Venture Capitalist (Self-Actualization Mode)

### Scenario
- VC earns $10 million from successful exit
- Reaction: "Good, but I want to do a bigger deal next time"
- Focus: Achievement and capability demonstration

### Diagnosis
- **Mode**: Self-Actualization
- **Money Role**: Scorecard for success and capability
- **Motivation Pattern**: Boundless; each success motivates pursuit of larger challenges

## Common Pitfalls

### Assuming Money Motivates Everyone
- Not all employees are money-motivated
- Some value time, autonomy, or recognition more
- Use diagnostic to identify actual motivators

### Using Wrong Compensation Strategy
- Offering more money to someone at esteem level when they need recognition
- Offering status symbols to someone struggling with basic needs
- Match strategy to diagnosed motivation mode
