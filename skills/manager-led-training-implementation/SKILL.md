# Manager-Led Training Implementation

## When to Use
- Manager decides to implement a training program for subordinates
- Need to upskill team members on specific domain knowledge
- Preparing to teach or train others for the first time
- Subject matter experts assigned to teach their expertise

## Part 1: Training Implementation Process

### 1. Identify Training Needs
- Create a list of topics subordinates should be trained in
- Include both simple tasks (taking calls) and broad concepts (objectives, value systems)
- Ask subordinates what they feel they need to uncover unknown needs

### 2. Resource Inventory and Prioritization
- Take inventory of available manager-teachers and instructional materials
- Assign priorities to items on the training list

### 3. Initial Course Design
- Start unambitiously with one short course (3-4 lectures) on the most urgent subject
- Be aware: explaining skills you possess is harder than practicing them
- Avoid excessive background information that obscures the course objective

### 4. Preparation and Launch
- Set a schedule with deadlines to prevent getting bogged down
- Create an outline for the whole course
- Develop only the first lecture and begin teaching

### 5. Iterative Development
- Develop the second lecture only after delivering the first
- **Accept**: The first delivery is a "throwaway" and will be unsatisfactory
- Mitigate damage by teaching first version to knowledgeable subordinates who can provide interaction and critique

### 6. Scalability Assessment
- Determine if you can teach all members personally
- If requiring many repetitions (10-20 courses), use train-the-trainer model
- Train a few instructors using the first set of lectures

### 7. Feedback and Evaluation
- Request anonymous critiques from employees after the course
- Use a form prompting for numerical ratings and open-ended questions
- Expect mixed feedback (too detailed, too superficial, just right in equal balance)
- Aim to satisfy yourself that objectives are met, not to please everyone

## Part 2: Realities and Rewards of First-Time Teaching

### Acknowledge the Difficulty
- Teaching is "hard work" involving lecture preparation and handling unpredictable questions
- **You will discover knowledge gaps**: Even with long-term experience, you'll realize "how much you don't know"
- **Key Principle**: "Much deeper knowledge of a task is required to teach that task than simply to do it"
- **Analogy**: Consider explaining over the phone how to drive a stick-shift car
- **Emotional Management**: Do not be discouraged – this discovery is "typical"

### Recognize Your Learning Benefit
- **Primary Beneficiary**: You will learn the most from the course
- **Outcome**: Course development provides "crispness" to your understanding of your own work
- This improved understanding makes the effort "extremely worthwhile" in itself

### Leverage Emotional Rewards
- **Immediate Reward**: Successful training process is "nothing short of exhilarating"
- **Ultimate Reward**: Seeing a subordinate practice the taught material creates a "warm feeling" that "dwarfs" the exhilaration
- **Strategic Advice**: "Relish the exhilaration and warmth" to build resilience for tackling the second course
