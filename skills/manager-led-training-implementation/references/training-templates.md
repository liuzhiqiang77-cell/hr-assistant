## Train-the-Trainer Model Example

### Scenario: Training 100 employees on new process

**Direct Delivery Approach:**
- Manager teaches 100 employees in 10 sessions of 10 people each
- Time commitment: ~40 hours

**Train-the-Trainer Approach:**
1. Manager selects 5 experienced employees as instructors
2. Manager delivers course to 5 instructors (5 hours)
3. Each instructor trains 20 employees (2 sessions each × 5 instructors = 10 sessions)
4. Instructor delivery time: 20 hours
5. Manager time commitment: 5 hours + occasional check-ins
6. Total time: ~25 hours + scalability for future training

## First-Time Teaching Reality Check

### Expected Discoveries
- "I don't know why we do it this way"
- "I can't explain this simply"
- "There are exceptions I forgot about"
- "This is harder than I thought"

### These Are Normal
- Even experienced experts discover gaps when teaching
- The process of explaining reveals unconscious knowledge
- Each gap discovery is an opportunity to deepen understanding

### Benefits to Instructor
1. **Crisper understanding** of own work
2. **Identified gaps** that need addressing
3. **Improved credibility** as subject matter expert
4. **Developed instructional skills** useful for future leadership
5. **Enhanced empathy** for learners
