# Compensation and Promotion Management

This skill covers compensation design, promotion cycles, and employee recycling for over-promoted staff.

## When to Use
- Designing or reviewing compensation structures for middle or senior managers
- Evaluating employees for promotion based on performance ratings
- Managing promoted employees who are performing below average

## Middle Manager Compensation System Design

### Part 1: Performance Bonus (Variable Pay)

#### Step 1: Determine Bonus Percentage

| Role | Bonus Percentage | Reasoning |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| Middle Manager | 10% to 25% of total compensation | Higher earners need higher percentage for meaningful feedback |
| Senior Manager | Up to 50% of total compensation | Avoids hardship from fluctuations while maintaining incentive |

#### Step 2: Define Bonus Factors

**Recommended 3-Factor Split** (e.g., for 20% total comp):
1. **Individual Performance** (judged by supervisor)
2. **Immediate Team Objective Performance** (e.g., department metrics)
3. **Overall Corporate Financial Performance**

**Scope Options**:
- Project team
- Division
- Entire Corporation

#### Step 3: Establish Timing
- Pay bonus close enough to work time so subordinate remembers why it was awarded
- Account for cause/effect time offsets

#### Step 4: Select Metrics

| Metric Type | Examples | Caution |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Countable items | Financial results | — |
| Measurable objectives | KPIs, OKRs | — |
| Subjective elements | Leadership, teamwork | May lead to "beauty contest" |

### Part 2: Salary Administration (Base Pay)

#### Step 1: Select Administration Scheme

| Option | Description | Viability |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Experience-Only | Pay based strictly on time (X time = Y pay) | Easiest, but ignores merit |
| Merit-Only | Pay based on performance only | Impractical, hard to ignore experience |
| Compromise (Recommended) | "Family of curves" | Starts everyone same, different speeds based on performance |

**Compromise Approach**:
- Start everyone at same salary level
- Individuals move up at different speeds based on performance
- Shape approximates experience-only curve but allows variance

#### Step 2: Implement Competitive Ranking
- Accept that merit-based systems require competitive, comparative evaluation
- **Principle**: If someone is first, someone else must be last (similar to sports rankings)

## Promotion Performance Cycle Logic

### The Cycle

1. **Initial State**: Employee at Job 1 performing at "meets requirements" (average level)
2. **Improvement Phase**: Training and motivation improve performance to "exceeds requirements" (above-average)
3. **Promotion Trigger**: Employee "exceeds requirements" → considered "promotable" → promoted to Job 2
4. **Performance Reset**: Upon entering Job 2, employee initially performs at "meets requirements" due to new challenges
5. **Cycle Repetition**: With experience, employee improves to "exceeds requirements" → another promotion
6. **Cycle Conclusion**: Employee settles at "meets requirements" and is no longer promoted (reaching "level of incompetence")

### Critical Constraint
If an employee "exceeds the requirements" but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will **atrophy** and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements."

### Promotion Decision Rule

| Performance Rating | Action |
|-------------------|--------|
| Meets requirements | Maintain current level |
| Exceeds requirements | Evaluate for promotion |

## Employee Recycling Procedure

### When to Apply
A promoted employee performs below-average for an extended period in their new role.

### Execution Steps

1. **Identification**: Recognize the person has been promoted "so much over his head" that they perform below-average for extended time

2. **Solution Selection**: Choose to "recycle" rather than terminate

3. **Definition of Recycling**: Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion

4. **Management Accountability**: Admit management was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness"

5. **Implementation**: Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do

6. **Support System**: Support the employee in the face of likely "embarrassment"

7. **Transparency**: Execute the recycling "openly" to reduce stigma

8. **Expected Outcome**: Embarrassment will be "short-lived" and employee will regain confidence

9. **Future Value**: Once confidence is regained, employee becomes an "excellent candidate for another promotion" at a later time

### Prohibited Action
**Do NOT force the employee to leave the company.** Reject the rationalization that "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake."

## Key Constraints

- Do not pay out lavishly if the company is going bankrupt
- Finite money resource requires allocation choices
- Performance is hard to assess precisely for middle managers (not paid by piece, woven into team)
- Societal stigma regarding demotion must be overcome
- Management tendency to view recycling as personal failure must be resisted
