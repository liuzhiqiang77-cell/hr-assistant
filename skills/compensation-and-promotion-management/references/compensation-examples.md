# Compensation Design Examples

## Example 1: Middle Manager Compensation Package

**Base Salary**: $100,000
**Bonus Target**: 20% of total compensation

**Bonus Calculation**:
- Total Compensation = $100,000 / 0.8 = $125,000
- Bonus Pool = $25,000

**3-Factor Split**:
1. Individual Performance (50%): $12,500
2. Department Performance (30%): $7,500
3. Corporate Financial Performance (20%): $5,000

**Actual Payout**:
- Individual rating: Exceeds expectations (120% of target) → $15,000
- Department met target: 100% → $7,500
- Corporate exceeded target: 110% → $5,500
- **Total Bonus**: $28,000

## Example 2: Senior Manager Compensation Package

**Base Salary**: $200,000
**Bonus Target**: 40% of total compensation

**Bonus Calculation**:
- Total Compensation = $200,000 / 0.6 = $333,333
- Bonus Pool = $133,333

**3-Factor Split**:
1. Individual Performance (40%): $53,333
2. Division Performance (40%): $53,333
3. Corporate Financial Performance (20%): $26,667

## Example 3: Promotion Cycle Timeline

- Action: Promoted to Job Level 2

**Year 4**: Senior Engineer at Job Level 2
- Performance: Meets requirements (learning new role)

**Year 5**: Senior Engineer at Job Level 2
- Performance: Exceeds requirements
- Action: Promoted to Job Level 3 (Engineering Manager)

**Year 6**: Engineering Manager at Job Level 3
- Performance: Meets requirements (struggling with people management)

**Year 7-10**: Engineering Manager at Job Level 3
- Performance: Consistently meets requirements

## Example 4: Employee Recycling Scenario

**Situation**: John promoted from Senior Engineer to Engineering Manager after 2 years of exceeding expectations.

**Problem**: After 6 months as manager, John's team is underperforming, missing deadlines, and morale is low. John is clearly struggling with people management.

**Analysis**: John was promoted too quickly. His technical excellence did not translate to management capability.

**Action**: Recycling
- Manager admits mistake in promotion timing
- John returned to Senior Engineer role with salary adjustment
- Manager supports John openly, explaining the move as "better alignment of skills"

**Outcome**:
- Short-term embarrassment for John (2-3 months)
- John regains confidence as top-performing engineer
- After 18 months, John expresses interest in management again
- John provided with management training and mentorship
- John promoted to Engineering Manager 2 years later and succeeds
