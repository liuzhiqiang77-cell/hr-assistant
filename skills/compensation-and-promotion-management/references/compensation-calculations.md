# Compensation Design Calculations

## Bonus Percentage Determination

### Middle Manager Example

**Scenario**: Manager with $100,000 total compensation

**Calculation**:
- Target bonus: 20% (within 10-25% range)
- Bonus amount: $100,000 × 20% = $20,000
- Base salary: $80,000

**Rationale**: 20% provides meaningful feedback without causing hardship from fluctuations.

### Senior Manager Example

**Scenario**: Senior manager with $300,000 total compensation

**Calculation**:
- Target bonus: 40% (within up-to-50% range)
- Bonus amount: $300,000 × 40% = $120,000
- Base salary: $180,000

**Rationale**: Higher earners have less material utility for incremental dollars; higher percentage needed for motivation.

## 3-Factor Bonus Split Example

**Total Bonus**: $20,000 (20% of $100,000)

| Factor | Weight | Amount | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Individual Performance | 50% | $10,000 | Supervisor judgment |
| Team Objective | 30% | $6,000 | Department KPIs |
| Corporate Financial | 20% | $4,000 | Company profit/revenue |

**Payout Calculation**:
- Individual rating: "Exceeds" → 120% of target = $12,000
- Team objective: Met 90% → $6,000 × 90% = $5,400
- Corporate financial: Exceeded → $4,000 × 110% = $4,400
- **Total bonus**: $21,800

## Family of Curves Salary Administration

### Curve Structure

**Years of Experience | Base Salary | Performance Variance**

| Years | Base | Low Perf | Target | High Perf |
|-------|------|----------|--------|----------|
| 0 | $50,000 | $50,000 | $50,000 | $50,000 |
| 2 | $60,000 | $55,000 | $60,000 | $65,000 |
| 5 | $75,000 | $65,000 | $75,000 | $85,000 |
| 10 | $100,000 | $85,000 | $100,000 | $115,000 |

### Movement Logic

- **Low performer**: Moves up slowly, may plateau
- **Target performer**: Follows base curve
- **High performer**: Moves up faster, reaches higher levels

## Training Volume Calculation

### Task 1: New Member Training

**Formula**: `Annual Training Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)`

**Example**:
- Turnover: 10%
- Growth: 10%
- Training load: 20% of staff annually

### Task 2: New Skill Training

**Formula**: `Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load`

**Example**:
- Task 1 load: 20%
- Task 2 magnitude: 100% / 20% = 5x
- Training all staff is 5 times larger effort than training new hires

### Cost Calculation

**One-day course for middle managers**:
- 50 managers × 8 hours = 400 student hours
- Fully loaded cost: ~$2,500/hour
- **Total cost**: $1,000,000

**Implication**: Enter Task 2 (training all staff) only when clearly justified.
