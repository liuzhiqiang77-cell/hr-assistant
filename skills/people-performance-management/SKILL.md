# People and Performance Management

## When to Use
- Employee is not performing their job duties
- Scheduling one-on-one meetings with direct reports
- Considering friendship with a subordinate
- Needing to improve team member output
- Determining whether to train or motivate an employee

## Employee Performance Diagnosis

### Trigger Condition
Employee is not performing their job duties effectively.

### Execution Steps

1. **Identify Underperformance**
   - Observe that employee is not doing their job
   - Gather specific examples of performance gaps

2. **Determine Root Cause**
   Categorize the issue into one of two buckets:
   - **Can't do it**: Employee lacks capability (Training issue)
   - **Won't do it**: Employee lacks motivation (Motivation issue)

3. **Select Intervention**
   - If **Can't do**: Train the employee
   - If **Won't do**: Motivate the employee

4. **Apply Constraint**
   - There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output
   - All performance issues reduce to training or motivation

## Adapted One-on-One Meeting Protocol

### Trigger Conditions
- Electronic information sharing is available (email/networks)
- Span of control has increased (more direct reports)

### Execution Steps

1. **Assess Information Availability**
   - Recognize employees are aware of developments through computer networks
   - They no longer rely solely on managers for basic updates

2. **Adjust Frequency**
   - Do not meet as often with larger number of direct reports (e.g., 10) vs fewer (e.g., 5)
   - Reduce frequency compared to past standards

3. **Adjust Duration**
   - Conduct shorter meetings
   - Focus time efficiently

4. **Refine Purpose**
   Focus on "mutual education and exchange of information":
   - **Supervisor role**: Teach skills and know-how, suggest approaches
   - **Subordinate role**: Provide detailed information on specific work, problems, concerns
   - Avoid general status updates (covered electronically)

5. **Validate Necessity**
   - Confirm one-on-ones are still absolutely necessary
   - Scope narrowed to education and specific issues

## Manager-Friendship Compatibility Test

### Trigger Condition
Considering establishing a friendship with a subordinate.

### Execution Steps

1. **Visualization Exercise**
   - Imagine yourself delivering a tough performance review to the person
   - Picture the specific conversation and feedback

2. **Assess Physical/Emotional Reaction**
   - **Scenario A**: You cringe at the thought
   - **Scenario B**: Your stomach remains unaffected

3. **Apply Decision Rule**
   - **IF Scenario A (Cringe)**: Do not make friends at work
     - Relationship will likely hinder professional duties
   - **IF Scenario B (Unaffected)**: Proceed with friendship
     - Personal relationships will likely strengthen work relationships

4. **Personal Decision**
   - Everyone must decide for themselves
   - Base decision on your honest emotional reaction

## Key Principles
