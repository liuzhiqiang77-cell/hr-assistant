# Subordinate Assessment and Retention

Effectively managing individual relationships requires assessing capability, making sound decisions about personal connections, and acting decisively when valuable employees threaten to leave.

## Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

TRM is task-specific maturity—not general competence or experience.

1. **Define TRM**: A combination of:
   - Achievement orientation (drive to achieve)
   - Readiness to take responsibility
   - Relevant education, training, and experience

2. **Assess Specificity**: Recognize that TRM is very specific to the task at hand
   - A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another
   - Even seasoned managers may have low TRM in new environments or with rapidly changing tasks

3. **Identify TRM Changes**: TRM can change day by day or hour by hour
   - Drops when job pace accelerates
   - Drops when job content abruptly changes
   - Increases with specific task experience

4. **Avoid Confusion**: Do not confuse general maturity with task-relevant maturity

## Evaluate Manager-Subordinate Friendship

Before establishing a friendship with a subordinate, perform the compatibility test:

1. **Visualization**: Imagine yourself delivering a tough performance review to the person

2. **Assess Your Reaction**:
   - **Scenario A**: You cringe at the thought → Do not make friends at work
   - **Scenario B**: Your stomach remains unaffected → Proceed with friendship

3. **Decision Logic**: 
   - If you cringe, the relationship will likely hinder professional duties
   - If unaffected, personal relationships will likely strengthen work relationships

## Execute Retention Procedure for Valued Subordinates

When a valued, dedicated subordinate resigns due to feeling unappreciated (not purely for money or perks):

**Phase 1: Immediate Reaction (The Opening Skirmish)**
1. Drop everything immediately
2. Sit the subordinate down and ask why they're quitting
3. Let them talk completely—do not argue, lecture, or panic
4. Allow rehearsed points, then ask more questions to uncover real issues
5. Convey through actions that they are important to you
6. Do not try to change their mind yet; focus on buying time

**Phase 2: Supervisor Involvement**
1. Go to your supervisor for help and advice
2. Make the resignation your supervisor's problem to ensure they participate in the solution

**Phase 3: Corporate Citizenship and Solution Pursuit**
1. Vigorously pursue every avenue to keep the employee, even transferring to another department
2. Become the project manager of the solution until settled
3. Apply the Golden Rule: You owe it to the employer to save an employee for the company

**Phase 4: Present the Solution**
1. Return with a solution addressing real reasons and benefiting the company
2. Reframe to alleviate "blackmailer" fears: "You did not blackmail us. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways"

**Phase 5: Counter External Offers**
1. If they've accepted another job, make them "quit again" (renounce the other offer)
2. Emphasize that commitments to daily colleagues are stronger than to a casual new acquaintance

## When to Use This Skill

- When deciding how much supervision a subordinate needs for a specific task
- When considering befriending someone you supervise
- When a valued employee announces resignation
- When assessing whether a subordinate is ready for increased responsibility
- When evaluating why a high-performer is struggling in a new role
