# Candidate Interviewing Techniques

Apply these techniques during an interview session to comprehensively evaluate a job candidate.

## Core Assessment Questions

Ask these specific recommended questions to assess the candidate:

- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

## Categorize Inquiries

Ensure comprehensive coverage by categorizing questions:

- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, weaknesses
- **What They Did With Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures
- **Discrepancies**: Learning from failures, problems in current position
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new job, why the company should hire them

## Use Direct Questions

- Ask blunt questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?") to elicit direct answers
- Observe the candidate's reaction and the confidence/timidity of the response to gauge actual capability

## Employ Hypothetical Situations

- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps)
- Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result (e.g., finished cost of a wafer) to discover their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly

## Invite Candidate Questions

- Ask the candidate what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job
- Analyze their questions to determine what they already know, what they value, and how prepared they are

## Constraints

- Limited time (typically an hour or two)
- Candidate may provide self-assessment
