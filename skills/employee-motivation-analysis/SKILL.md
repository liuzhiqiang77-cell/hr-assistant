description: Analyze and diagnose employee motivation using Maslow's hierarchy framework and behavioral indicators. Use when you need to understand what drives an individual's behavior, determine which needs are currently dominant, diagnose reactions to compensation changes, or identify why motivation strategies are failing.

# Employee Motivation Analysis

## When to Use This Skill
- A manager needs to improve output and the root cause appears to be motivation-related
- You need to understand what drives a specific employee's behavior
- An employee reacts unexpectedly to compensation changes
- You're designing motivation strategies for different worker types (knowledge workers vs. manual laborers)
- You need to identify which needs are currently dominant for an individual or team

## Core Principles

### The Nature of Motivation
- **Motivation comes from within**: A manager cannot directly motivate another person; they can only influence the environment
- **Manager's role**: Create an environment where motivated people can flourish
- **Focus on output, not attitude**: Better motivation equals better performance, not a change of feeling. Attitude is merely an indicator, not the desired result
- **Worker type matters**: 
  - Manual labor: Output is measurable; fear-based approaches historically worked
  - Knowledge workers: Output is hard to measure; humanistic approaches are required

### Maslow's Hierarchy Dynamics

**The Chain of Causality:**
Needs → Drives → Motivation

**Key Rules:**
1. **Satiation Rule**: A need once satisfied stops being a source of motivation
2. **Maintenance Requirement**: Keep some needs unsatisfied to maintain high motivation
3. **Dominance Principle**: One need is always stronger than others and determines behavior
4. **Hierarchical Progression**: When lower needs are satisfied, higher needs take over
5. **Regressive Movement**: Drastic environmental changes can cause instant regression to fundamental needs

## Analysis Procedures

### Step 1: Identify the Dominant Need Level

Map the individual's behavior to one of these need levels:

| Need Level | Driver | Key Indicators |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Physiological** | Fear of deprivation | Focus on basic necessities, money for survival |
| **Safety/Security** | Protection against loss | Focus on stability, insurance, avoiding catastrophic loss |
| **Social/Affiliation** | Companionship and belonging | Values team identity, seeks like-minded colleagues |
| **Esteem/Recognition** | Recognition from reference group | "Keeping up with the Joneses," status-focused |
| **Self-Actualization** | Achieving personal best | Testing limits, continuous improvement, boundless motivation |

### Step 2: Apply the Money Motivation Diagnostic Test

When analyzing reactions to compensation changes:

**Observe the employee's reaction to a raise:**

- **Scenario A: Focus on ABSOLUTE SUM**
  - Employee motivated by Physiological or Safety needs
  - Money is a utilitarian resource
  - Motivation ceases when monetary target is met
  - Example: Workers quitting after reaching a savings goal

- **Scenario B: Focus on RELATIVE COMPARISON**
  - Employee motivated by Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization
  - Money is a measure of achievement/scorecard
  - Motivation is boundless
  - Example: Venture Capitalists, executives

### Step 3: Determine Management Implications

**For Lower-Level Needs (Physiological/Safety):**
- Money satisfies deficit needs
- Motivation is finite and goal-oriented
- Once target reached, need extinguishes

**For Upper-Level Needs (Esteem/Self-Actualization):**
- Money satisfies growth needs
- Motivation is self-renewing
- Money serves as achievement scorecard

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing attitude with performance**: An employee saying "I feel motivated" means nothing if output doesn't improve
- **Applying fear to knowledge workers**: Fear-based motivation fails when output is hard to measure
- **Assuming needs are isolated**: Multiple needs exist concurrently; identify the dominant one
- **Ignoring regression triggers**: Major changes (layoffs, crises) can instantly shift motivation to survival mode

## Output

A motivation analysis report identifying:
1. The currently dominant unsatisfied need
2. Whether money functions as utilitarian resource or achievement measure
3. Recommended environmental adjustments for the specific worker type
