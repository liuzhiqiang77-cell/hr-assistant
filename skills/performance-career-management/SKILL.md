# Performance and Career Management

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when:
- An employee is not performing their job duties
- Planning a new product or project
- Making promotion decisions
- Managing your own career development
- Addressing slow/no-growth environment threats

## Employee Performance Diagnosis

### When to Apply
- Employee is not performing job duties
- Role and expectations are clearly defined
- Need to determine intervention strategy

### Diagnosis Framework

**Step 1: Identify Underperformance**
- Confirm employee is not meeting expectations
- Document specific performance gaps

**Step 2: Categorize Root Cause**

| Category | Question | Issue Type |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Can't do it | Does the employee lack the capability? | Training issue |
| Won't do it | Does the employee lack the motivation? | Motivation issue |

**Step 3: Select Intervention**
- If **Can't do**: Train the employee
- If **Won't do**: Motivate the employee

**Critical Constraint:**
There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train.

## Product Planning Energy Principle

### When to Apply
- Planning a new product or project
- Identifying gaps in current output
- Allocating resources across project lifecycle

### Core Principle

**Today's Gap = Failure of Past Planning**
Any gap identified today represents a failure of planning sometime in the past.

### Energy Allocation Strategy

| Timing | Energy Investment | ROI Multiplier |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Beginning of process | Maximum energy | +10x |
| End of program | Minimal energy | -10x |

### Execution
1. **Invest Early:** Put maximum energy at the beginning of the process
2. **Prevent Rather Than Fix:** Focus on prevention and early design
3. **Avoid Last-Minute Efforts:** Energy at the end has negative returns
4. **Strategic Implication:** Early planning pays off tenfold; late fixes cost tenfold

## The Peter Principle

### When to Apply
- Making promotion decisions
- Designing promotion systems
- Diagnosing management incompetence

### Core Concept

"In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

### Mechanism

**Step 1: Selection Criteria**
- Candidate selected based on performance in current role
- Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"

**Step 2: Promotion Trajectory**
- Employee promoted due to current success
- Continues being promoted until reaching a role they are not skilled for

**Step 3: Outcome**
- Employee stops being promoted once no longer competent
- Result: "Managers rise to the level of their incompetence"

### Prevention Strategies
- Base promotions on competencies specific to intended role
- Assess skills required for new position, not current position
- Use trial periods or acting roles before permanent promotion

## Sole Proprietor Career Management Mindset

### When to Apply
- You are employed or seeking employment
- Navigating career decisions
- Planning long-term employability
- Facing internal threats (ambitious juniors)

### Core Mindset Shift

**From Employee to Sole Proprietor:**
- You are not an employee
- You are a business with one employee: yourself
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- "Nobody owes you a career"—you own it

### Daily Career Management Actions

1. **Retain Competitive Advantage**
   - Continually dedicate yourself to retaining individual competitive advantage
   - Enhance your value every day
   - Hone your competitive advantage

2. **Learn and Adapt**
   - Learn constantly
   - Adapt to changing conditions
   - Be willing to move job to job or industry to industry
   - Retrench if necessary to start again

3. **Goal:** Manage your career to avoid becoming a casualty of globalization and the information revolution

### Addressing Internal Threats

**Threat:** Ambitious junior employees desiring upward movement but blocked by your position

**Boss's Dilemma:** Choosing between retaining you (doing good job but blocking others) or promoting the junior

**Your Responsibility:** Avoid being "in the way"—move up or move on

### Self-Assessment Protocol (The 3 Questions)

**Question 1: Value Addition**
- Ask: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"
- Action: Continually look for ways to make things truly better
- Principle: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization"
- Standard: Every hour should increase output or value of output of people you're responsible for

**Question 2: Connectivity**
- Ask: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?" (inside company and industry)
- Check: Do not wait for supervisor to interpret events
- Status: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people"

**Question 3: Innovation**
- Ask: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"
- Action: Personally try new things; don't just read about them
- Warning: Don't wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of it

- Apply methods of production
- Exercise managerial leverage
- Elicit an athlete's desire for peak performance
