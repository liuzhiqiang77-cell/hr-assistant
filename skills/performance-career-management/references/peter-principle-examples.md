# Peter Principle: Detailed Examples

## Example 1: Technical Specialist to Manager

**Current Role:** Senior Engineer (excellent technical performance)

**Promotion Decision:** Based on engineering excellence

**New Role:** Engineering Manager

**Required Skills (Missing):**
- People management
- Conflict resolution
- Strategic thinking
- Communication

**Outcome:** Engineer rises to level of incompetence—poor manager, cannot return to technical role without perceived demotion

## Example 2: Sales Representative to Sales Director

**Current Role:** Top-performing sales rep (consistently exceeds quota)

**Promotion Decision:** Based on sales numbers

**New Role:** Sales Director

**Required Skills (Missing):**
- Team leadership
- Territory planning
- Budget management
- Organizational politics

**Outcome:** Excellent salesperson becomes ineffective director—team performance suffers

## Prevention Strategies

### Competency-Based Promotion
1. Define competencies required for target role
2. Assess candidate against those competencies
3. Use behavioral interviews, not just performance reviews
4. Consider skill gaps as disqualifiers

### Dual Career Ladders
1. Technical track: Individual contributor progression
2. Management track: People leadership progression
3. Equal compensation and status at equivalent levels
4. Allows specialists to advance without management

### Trial Periods
1. Acting roles before permanent promotion
2. Clear evaluation criteria
3. Reversion option without stigma
4. Specific timebox for assessment

## Historical Context

**Author:** Laurence J. Peter (1969 book)
**Popularized by:** Ben Horowitz (2015)
**Observation:** Hierarchical promotion systems inherently promote until incompetence

## Applicability

Applies when:
- Hierarchical promotion structure exists
- Selection based on past performance data
- Skills required for new role differ from current role

Does NOT apply when:
- Selection based on competencies specific to intended role
- Skills required for new role are identical to current role
- Flat organization without promotion hierarchy
