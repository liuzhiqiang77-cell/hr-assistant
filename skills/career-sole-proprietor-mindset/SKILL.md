# Sole Proprietor Career Management Mindset

## Core Philosophy

You are not an employee—you are a business with one employee: yourself.

You own your career. Nobody owes you a career.

## Adopt the Sole Proprietor Mindset

### Recognize Your Reality

**Global Competition**
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- Fellow workers are not your primary rivals
- Rivals outnumber you by ratios of 1,000:1, 100,000:1, or 1,000,000:1
- These rivals work for competing organizations worldwide

**Globalization and Information Revolution**
- Capital and work can go anywhere on earth
- Skills are more accessible globally than ever
- Information travels instantly worldwide
- Distance no longer protects your career

### Execute Daily Career Management

**Continually**:
- Dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competitive advantage
- Enhance your value every day
- Hone your competitive advantage
- Learn and adapt constantly
- Be willing to move from job to job
- Be willing to move from industry to industry
- Retrench and start again if necessary

**Goal**: Manage your career to avoid becoming a casualty of globalization and the information revolution.

## Address Internal Threats

### Slow or No-Growth Environments

**Identify the Threat**:
- Ambitious junior employees who desire upward movement
- These juniors are blocked by your position
- Your good performance creates a dilemma for your boss

**Anticipate the Boss's Dilemma**:
- Choice 1: Retain you (doing a good job but blocking others)
- Choice 2: Promote the junior (freeing up movement)

**Take Responsibility**:
- Avoid being "in the way"
- Move up (seek promotion) or move on (find new opportunity)
- Don't wait to be pushed out

## The Three Self-Assessment Questions

Ask these questions regularly to assess your career position:

### Question 1: Value Addition

**Ask**: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"

**Action**:
- Continually look for ways to make things truly better in your department
- Don't just be a conduit for information
- Create actual improvements and outcomes

**Principle**: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization."

**Standard**: Every hour of the day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people you are responsible for.

### Question 2: Connectivity

**Ask**: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"

**Scope**:
- Inside the company
- In your industry
- In your field broadly

**Check**:
- Do not wait for a supervisor to interpret events for you
- Be proactive about gathering information
- Build your own network of sources

**Status**: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people" rather than "floating by yourself."

### Question 3: Innovation

**Ask**: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"

**Action**:
- Personally try new things
- Do not just read about them
- Hands-on experimentation

**Warning**: Do not wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of that workplace.

## When to Use This Mindset

- You are employed or seeking employment
- Planning career development or advancement
- Self-assessing your performance and positioning
- Navigating competitive job markets
- Preparing for organizational changes
- Considering job or industry changes
- Feeling stuck or plateaued in your career

## Apply Productivity Principles to Your Career

Treat yourself like you would treat a business:
- **Output orientation**: What value do you produce?
- **Managerial leverage**: Which of your activities have the highest impact on your value?
- **Peak performance**: Elicit an athlete's desire for continuous improvement

## Key Constraints

- Does NOT apply to environments with absolute job security (rare/non-existent today)
- Requires willingness to face uncomfortable truths about your position
- Demands proactive behavior rather than reactive response
- Accepts that the world has changed and old assumptions no longer hold
