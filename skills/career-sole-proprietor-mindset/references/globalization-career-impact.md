### Before (Pre-1980s)
- Geography protected careers
- Local knowledge was valuable
- Companies retained employees for life

## The "Larger Tide"

Andy Grove recognized that competitive pressures were not isolated incidents:
- "Just one wave of a much larger tide—the tide of globalization"
- Business knows no national boundaries
- Information revolution eliminated hiding places
- Capital flows to highest returns globally
- Talent competes globally

# Self-Assessment Deep Dive

## Question 1: Value Addition - Detailed Analysis

### "Merely Passing Information Along" Examples
- Forwarding emails without adding insight
- Repeating what others said in meetings
- Scheduling meetings without clarifying purpose
- Writing reports that summarize but don't recommend
- Being a conduit rather than a source

### "Adding Real Value" Examples
- Improving a process to save time or reduce errors
- Solving a recurring problem
- Teaching others to be more effective
- Making a decision that moves work forward
- Creating something new or better

### Assessing Your Value
- What would happen if you stopped doing what you do?
- Would the work still get done? Would it get done as well?
- Are you a multiplier (making others more effective) or an adder?
- Are there tasks you do that could be automated or eliminated?

## Question 2: Connectivity - Detailed Analysis

### Signs You're "Floating by Yourself"
- You learn about company news from official announcements only
- You don't know people outside your immediate team
- You rely on your boss for all information about the broader organization
- You don't have sources outside your company
- You're surprised by industry changes

### Signs You're a "Connected Node"
- You have informal information networks
- You know people across the organization
- You have external contacts in your field
- You hear about changes before they're announced
- You share information with others

### Building Connectivity
- Schedule regular coffee/lunch with people outside your team
- Attend industry events and conferences
- Join professional associations
- Follow thought leaders in your field
- Share useful information with your network
- Be helpful to others—networking is reciprocal

## Question 3: Innovation - Detailed Analysis

### Why "Personally" Try New Things?
- Reading about change is not the same as experiencing it
- Firsthand experience builds intuition
- You learn what actually works, not just what's supposed to work
- You develop credibility from actual experience
- You discover unexpected applications and insights

### Examples of Hands-On Innovation
- Trying new software tools rather than reading reviews
- Experimenting with AI tools in your actual work
- Learning new methodologies by applying them
- Testing new approaches on small projects first
- Reverse-engineering new technologies to understand them

### The Danger of Waiting
- While you wait for others to figure it out, you're falling behind
- By the time "best practices" emerge, early adopters have moved on
- Your employer may re-engineer your workplace—and you out of it
- The gap between readers and doers becomes the competitive advantage
