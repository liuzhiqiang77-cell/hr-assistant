## The Boss's Dilemma Framework

### Situation Analysis

- Sees junior's potential
- Faces trade-off between stability and growth

### The Boss's Calculation

**Keep You**:
- Pros: Maintain current performance, no transition risk
- Cons: Lose junior employee, stagnation continues, team morale may suffer
