# Performance Indicators and Forecasting

## Principles of Effective Indicator Design

### Core Principles

1. **Attention Principle**: Indicators direct attention like steering a bicycle - you steer where you look
2. **Guard Against Overreaction**: Focusing on single metric leads to extreme behaviors
3. **Implement Paired Indicators**: Always pair indicators to measure both effect and counter-effect

### Administrative Indicator Criteria

- **Rule 1**: Any measurement is better than none
- **Rule 2**: Measure **Output** (results), not **Activity** (effort)
  - Example: Measure orders obtained, not calls made
- **Rule 3**: Measure **Physical/Countable** things
  - Examples: Vouchers processed, square feet cleaned, sales orders entered

### Paired Indicators Strategy

Pair Quantity/Output indicators with Quality indicators:

| Domain | Quantity Metric | Quality Metric |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Inventory | Inventory Level | Incidence of Shortages |
| Projects | Completion Date | Capability |
| Accounts Payable | # Vouchers processed | # Errors found |
| Custodial | # Square feet cleaned | Quality rating |

## Daily Operational Indicator Set

Review these indicators when starting daily operations:

1. **Sales Forecast**: Number of units planned for delivery today
2. **Variance Analysis**: Compare yesterday's actual vs. planned deliveries
3. **Raw Material Inventory**: Verify stock levels
   - Too low: Order more supplies immediately
   - Too high: Cancel scheduled deliveries
4. **Equipment Condition**: Check for breakdowns
   - If breakdown: Arrange repairs or rearrange production line
5. **Manpower Assessment**: Check staff availability
   - If understaffed: Call temporary help or reallocate staff
6. **Quality Indicator**: Review customer complaint log
   - If high complaints: Address with staff immediately

## Linearity Indicator Analysis

Monitor progress toward deadlines or monthly goals:

1. **Plot Actual Output**: Achieved results vs. time elapsed
2. **Define Ideal Straight Line**: Linear trajectory from start to target
3. **Compare Progress**:
   - Below line: Higher rate needed in remaining period
   - Back-loaded (end of month): Inefficient resource use
4. **Take Action**: Corrective action based on deviation

**Purpose**: Provides early warning before deadline passes

## Stagger Chart Forecasting

Track forecast accuracy and business trends:

1. **Create Matrix**: Rows = forecast month, Columns = target month
2. **Initial Forecast**: Fill in values for future months
3. **Update Monthly**: Add new row with updated forecasts
4. **Analyze Variations**: Compare forecasts for same target month made at different times
5. **Interpret**: Significant variation indicates changing business trends

**Benefit**: Shows evolution of expectations, forces accountability
