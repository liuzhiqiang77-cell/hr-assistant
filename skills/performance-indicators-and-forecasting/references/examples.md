## Linearity Indicator Example

### College Recruiting

**Progress:**
| Month | Target (Linear) | Actual | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Jan | 17 | 15 | Below line |

| Mar | 50 | 35 | **Below line - Action needed** |
| Apr | 67 | ? | |
| May | 83 | ? | |
| Jun | 100 | ? | |

**Analysis (end of March):**
- Should have 50 acceptances

- Need 65 more in 3 months = 21.7/month
- Original rate: 16.7/month
- **Action:** Increase recruiting intensity, add campus visits
