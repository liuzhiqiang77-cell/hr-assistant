**Working Days:** 20
**Ideal Daily Rate:** 500 units

| Day   | Cumulative Target | Actual | Variance | Required Daily Rate |
|-------|-------------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| 5     | 2,500             | 1,800  | -700     | 546                 |
| 10    | 5,000             | 4,200  | -800     | 577                 |

**Analysis:** Production consistently behind target. By day 15, need 667/day vs. 500/day ideal.

**Action:** Add overtime shift, identify bottlenecks, expedite material delivery.

## Scenario 3: Back-Loaded Delivery

**Pattern:** Most production occurs in last week of month

**Week 4:** 7,000 units (70% of target)

**Problems:**
- Equipment stress from last-minute surge
- Quality issues from rushing
- Overtime costs
- Risk of missing target if breakdown occurs

**Action:** Implement daily production quotas, smooth workload across month.
