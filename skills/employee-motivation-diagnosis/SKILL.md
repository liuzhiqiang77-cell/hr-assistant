# Employee Motivation Diagnosis

## When to Use
- Analyzing an employee's reaction to a raise or compensation change
- Determining what will motivate a specific employee
- Designing work environments for different worker types
- Distinguishing between attitude and performance issues

## Core Principle: Manager's Role

**Motivation must come from within the individual.** A manager cannot directly motivate another person.

### Manager's Action
Create an environment in which motivated people can flourish.

### Success Definition
- **Better motivation = Better performance** (NOT attitude change)
- A subordinate saying "I feel motivated" means nothing
- Attitude is merely an indicator (a "window into the black box"), not the desired result
- Desired result: Better performance at a given skill level

## Money Motivation Hierarchy Test

Use this diagnostic when analyzing reactions to compensation changes.

### Step 1: Observe Reaction Focus

**Scenario A: Absolute Sum Focus**
- Employee focuses on the absolute amount of money received
- Example: "I got $5,000 more per year"

**Scenario B: Relative Comparison Focus**
- Employee focuses on how their raise compares to others
- Example: "Did I get more than John?" or "Is this fair compared to market?"

### Step 2: Determine Motivation Mode

| Reaction Focus | Motivation Mode | Money Represents |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Absolute Sum | Physiological or Safety | Utilitarian resource for necessities |
| Relative Comparison | Esteem or Self-Actualization | Measure of achievement/scorecard |

### Step 3: Interpret Implications

**Lower Levels (Physiological/Safety):**
- Money satisfies a deficit need
- Motivation ceases once target is met
- Example: Workers quit after reaching savings goal

**Upper Levels (Esteem/Self-Actualization):**
- Money satisfies a growth need
- Motivation is boundless
- "The second ten million is just as important as the first"
- Example: Venture Capitalists, executives

## Worker Type Considerations

### Manual Laborers
- Output is readily measurable
- Fear of punishment historically worked (loss of life/food)
- Clear expectations possible

### Knowledge Workers
- Output is difficult to measure immediately
- Expectations are hard to state precisely
- Fear won't work as well
- **Require humanistic approaches**

## Key Diagnostic Questions

1. What is the employee trying to achieve or avoid?
2. Does money represent survival or success to them?
3. Who is their reference group for comparison?
4. What happens when they reach their goals?

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing attitude with performance** - Focus on output, not feelings
- **Assuming one approach fits all** - Manual laborers vs knowledge workers need different strategies
- **Trying to force motivation** - You can only influence the environment
- **Ignoring the reference group** - Recognition only matters from people the employee respects
