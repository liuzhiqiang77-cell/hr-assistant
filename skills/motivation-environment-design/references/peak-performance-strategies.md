# Peak Performance Strategies

## Driver Type Identification

### Competence-Driven
- **Focus:** Job or task mastery
- **Behavior:** Sharpening own skill, trying to do better than the time before
- **Example:** A violinist practicing daily or a teenager perfecting a skateboard trick
- **Management:** Provide opportunities for skill development and mastery progression

### Achievement-Driven
- **Focus:** Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors
- **Behavior:** Testing the limits of capability; working at the "boundary of their capability"
- **Management:** Provide challenging goals with 50% success probability

## Peg/Ring Experiment Classification

Based on behavioral response to risk and challenge:

- **Gamblers:** High risk, no influence on outcome
- **Conservatives:** Very little risk
- **Achievers:** Challenge themselves at the boundary of capability to test limits

## MBO Implementation Details

### Goal Difficulty Formula
Target success probability = approximately 50%

### Why 50% Works
- Striving for difficult goals produces greater output even when failing
- Easy goals produce complacency
- Impossible goals produce resignation
- 50% success rate maximizes effort and growth

## Culture Comparison

### Knowledge-Centered Culture
- Values: Abstract knowledge, credentials, knowing
- Problem: Low actual achievement; knowledge without application
- Example: Academic environments where theory is prized over results

### Output-Centered Culture
- Values: Tangible results, measurable outcomes, production
- Benefit: High actual achievement; knowledge applied to produce results
- Example: Engineering teams focused on shipping products
