# Competence-Driven vs Achievement-Driven

## Competence-Driven Characteristics

**Focus:**
- Mastery of specific job or task
- Improving personal performance over time
- Skill development and refinement

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- Practices deliberately to improve
- Compares current performance to past performance
- Seeks feedback on technique
- Values skill acquisition

**Examples:**
- Violinist practicing scales daily
- Programmer optimizing code for efficiency
- Craftsman perfecting a technique
- Teenager practicing skateboard trick repeatedly

## Achievement-Driven Characteristics

**Focus:**
- Abstract need to achieve across all endeavors
- Testing limits of capability
- Working at boundary of ability

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- Seeks challenging situations
- Takes calculated risks
- Compares performance to standards or others
- Values accomplishment and recognition

**The Peg/Ring Experiment Classification:**

**Gamblers:**
- High risk, no influence on outcome
- Not true achievers
- Example: Pure chance betting

**Conservatives:**
- Very little risk
- Avoids challenge
- Not true achievers
- Example: Always choosing easiest tasks

**Achievers:**
- Challenge themselves at boundary of capability
- 50% success probability is optimal
- Test limits intentionally
- Example: Setting difficult but attainable goals

## Commonality

Both types spontaneously try to test the outer limits of their abilities. The difference is in focus:
- Competence: Skill mastery within domain
- Achievement: Testing limits across domains

## Management Implications

**For Competence-Driven:**
- Provide opportunities for skill development
- Offer technical challenges
- Recognize mastery and improvement

**For Achievement-Driven:**
- Set challenging goals (50% success rate)
- Provide competitive benchmarks
- Recognize accomplishments and results
