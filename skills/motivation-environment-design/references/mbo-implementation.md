# MBO (Management by Objectives) Implementation Guide

## Core Principle

Set objectives at a difficulty level where the individual has only a "fifty-fifty chance" of making them, even if they push hard.

## Why 50% Success Probability?

**Output Maximization:**
- Output tends to be greater when striving for a level beyond immediate grasp
- Even with 50% failure rate, overall performance is higher
- People work harder at challenging goals

**Peak Performance:**
- Achieving personal best requires pushing limits
- Easy goals don't elicit maximum effort
- Impossible goals cause discouragement

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Define Clear Objectives

- Specific, measurable outcomes
- Time-bound with clear deadlines
- Aligned with organizational goals

### 2. Assess Current Capability

- Evaluate individual's current performance level
- Determine what constitutes "stretch"
- Identify boundary of capability

### 3. Set Target at 50% Probability

- Goal should be achievable but difficult
- Individual should believe success is possible
- Requires maximum effort and growth

### 4. Monitor Progress

- Regular check-ins on progress
- Adjust support as needed
- Don't lower the goal

### 5. Evaluate Results

- Focus on effort and growth, not just success/failure
- Learn from both achievements and misses
- Set next round of goals

## Common Pitfalls

- Setting goals too easy (guaranteed success)
- Setting goals too hard (certain failure)
- Not providing necessary resources
- Changing goals mid-period
- Focusing only on outcomes, not learning

## Examples

**Sales:**
- Current performance: $100K/month
- Stretch goal: $120K/month (requires new strategies)

**Engineering:**
- Current: 5 features per sprint
- Stretch: 7 features per sprint (requires process improvement)

**Research:**
- Current: 1 paper per quarter
- Stretch: 2 papers per quarter (requires higher efficiency)
