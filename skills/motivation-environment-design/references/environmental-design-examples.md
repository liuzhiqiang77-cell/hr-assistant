# Detailed Examples of Environmental Design

## Building Czar Example
Assign a "building czar" role to score facility maintenance across different buildings. Compare scores publicly. This creates immediate improvement through competition without requiring monetary rewards. Employees naturally want their building to be "best."

## Knowledge Worker vs Manual Labor Comparison
- **Galley slaves**: Fear of punishment (whips, death) effectively motivates physical labor
- **Computer architects**: Fear won't work—design quality can't be measured immediately; expectations are abstract; output isn't visible until project completion

## Sports Mindset Analogies
- **Losing as probability**: In sports, teams lose ~50% of matches. This doesn't cause them to quit. Work should be the same—failure is expected half the time when aiming at peak performance.
- **Coach behavior**: Coaches don't take credit for touchdowns. They push players to perform. They're tough but respected.

# Environmental Design Constraints

## Cultural Fit
The competitive sports model requires a culture that:
- Accepts feedback and criticism
- Views competition as healthy rather than destructive
- Values performance over comfort

## When to Avoid Competitive Approach
Do not use if:
- Competition leads to destructive behavior
- Team members cannot handle public comparison
- Work requires complete collaboration without individual attribution
- The culture is overly sensitive to failure
