# One-on-One Meeting Management

One-on-one meetings are the primary mechanism for coaching, information exchange, and building relationships with subordinates. This skill covers the complete workflow from scheduling to execution.

## When to Use

- Establishing regular communication with direct reports
- Coaching subordinates on specific tasks or problems
- Monitoring progress and identifying potential issues
- Exchanging information that cannot be efficiently shared electronically

## Determine Meeting Frequency

Assess the subordinate's **Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)**:
- TRM is the amount of experience a subordinate has with the specific task at hand
- This is distinct from general experience or age

**Base Frequency Rules:**
- **Low TRM (inexperienced)**: Meet weekly
- **High TRM (experienced veteran)**: Meet every few weeks

**Adjust for Rate of Change:**
- **High rate of change** (e.g., Marketing): Increase frequency to stay current on rapid developments
- **Low rate of change** (e.g., Research): Decrease frequency

**Adapt for Electronic Communication:**
- If electronic information sharing is available and span of control has increased:
  - Reduce frequency compared to traditional standards
  - Shorten duration
  - Focus on coaching and specific issues rather than general status updates

## Prepare for the Meeting

**Duration:**
- Minimum: 1 hour
- Anything less prevents discussion of complex problems

**Location:**
- Preferred: In or near the subordinate's work area
- Allows observation of organization, document retrieval, and work patterns

**Ownership:**
- The meeting belongs to the subordinate
- Subordinate prepares an outline in advance
- Agenda and tone are set by the subordinate

**Scheduling:**
- Use rolling basis: Set up the next meeting as the current one ends
- Avoids cancellations from fixed schedules

**Remote Meetings:**
- Supervisor must have the outline before the meeting begins
- Exchange notes after the meeting to confirm commitments

## Conduct the Meeting

**Content Scope:**
1. Performance figures and indicators (especially those signaling trouble)
2. Events since last meeting (hiring, people problems, organizational issues, future plans)
3. Potential problems (including intangible intuitions)
4. Issues that preoccupy and nag the subordinate

**Supervisor Role:**
- Facilitate the subordinate's expression of concerns
- Learn and coach
- Apply **Grove's Principle of Didactic Management**: "Ask one more question!"
  - When you think the subordinate is finished, ask another query to reach the root cause

**Mechanical Hints:**
- **Note-taking**: Both parties take notes on the outline
  - Keeps mind from drifting
  - Forces logical categorization
  - Writing implies commitment to action
- **Hold File**: Both accumulate important but non-urgent issues
  - Applies batching principle
  - Minimizes ad hoc interruptions

**Handle Heart-to-Heart Issues:**
- Encourage discussion of deep work-related problems
- **Beware the "Zinger"**: A major issue raised at the end with insufficient time to resolve
