# Handling the "Zinger" in One-on-Ones

## What is a Zinger?
A sensitive or critical issue raised at the very end of a one-on-one meeting, leaving insufficient time to address it properly.

## Common Zinger Examples
- "I'm thinking about quitting"
- "I have a serious ethical concern"
- "I'm dealing with a personal crisis affecting work"
- "I have a major conflict with a peer"

## Prevention Strategies

### Time Management
- Reserve final 15 minutes specifically for "any other concerns"
- Explicitly ask: "Is there anything else we need to discuss?" with 10 minutes remaining

### Relationship Building
- Foster psychological safety throughout the meeting
- Encourage openness from the start
- Use regular check-ins on satisfaction and concerns

## Response Strategies

### If a Zinger Occurs
1. **Acknowledge immediately**: "This is important and deserves proper attention"
2. **Assess urgency**: "Does this need to be addressed today, or can we schedule a dedicated session?"
3. **Take action**:
   - If urgent: Clear your schedule and address now
   - If not urgent: Schedule dedicated meeting within 24-48 hours
   - Document the issue and agreed next steps

### What NOT to Do
- Don't rush to a solution
- Don't dismiss or minimize
- Don't let it slide until next regular meeting
- Don't pretend it didn't come up
