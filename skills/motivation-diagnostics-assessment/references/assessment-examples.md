# Motivation Diagnostics - Examples and Case Studies

## Money Motivation Test Examples

### Example 1: The Absolute Sum Focus

**Scenario**: A software engineer receives a $10,000 raise.

**Reaction**: "Great! Now I can finally afford that down payment on a house I've been saving for."

**Diagnosis**: Physiological/Safety needs (Scenario A - Absolute Sum)
- Money is viewed as a utilitarian resource
- Motivation tied to reaching a specific financial goal
- Once the house is purchased, this particular motivation may diminish

**Management Implication**: 
- Understand that this employee has specific financial goals
- Consider how compensation relates to those goals
- Be aware that motivation may shift after goals are achieved

### Example 2: The Relative Comparison Focus

**Scenario**: A sales manager receives a $15,000 raise.

**Reaction**: "That's good, but I heard John got $20,000. Is my performance not as valued?"

**Diagnosis**: Esteem/Recognition needs (Scenario B - Relative Comparison)
- Money is viewed as a measure of achievement and recognition
- Motivation tied to status relative to peers
- Motivation is boundless - always striving for higher recognition

**Management Implication**:
- Ensure compensation is perceived as fair and equitable
- Recognize that this employee is driven by status and recognition
- Consider non-monetary recognition as well

### Example 3: The Achievement Scorecard

**Scenario**: A venture capitalist earns $5 million in a year.

**Reaction**: "Good year, but I want to hit $10 million next year. That's the benchmark for top-tier VCs."

**Diagnosis**: Self-Actualization/Achievement needs (Scenario B - Relative Comparison)
- Money is a scorecard for achievement
- Motivation is intrinsic and boundless
- Driven by testing limits and achieving personal best

**Management Implication**:
- This employee is self-driven and achievement-focused
- Provide challenging goals and opportunities to test limits
- Recognition should focus on achievement, not just compensation
