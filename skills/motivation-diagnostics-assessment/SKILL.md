# Motivation Diagnostics and Assessment

Use this skill to diagnose motivation levels and assess performance using structured frameworks.

## When to Use

- Analyzing an employee's reaction to a raise or compensation change
- Assessing a subordinate's performance
- Determining what level of Maslow's hierarchy is driving an employee
- Diagnosing whether motivation is the root cause of performance issues
- Evaluating the effectiveness of motivation strategies

## Diagnostic Tool 1: Money Motivation Hierarchy Test

Use this test to determine which level of Maslow's hierarchy is driving an employee based on their reaction to compensation.

### Procedure

1. **Observe the Reaction**: When an employee receives a salary increase or compensation change, observe what they focus on.

2. **Classify the Focus**:
   - **Scenario A**: The individual focuses on the ABSOLUTE SUM of the money received
   - **Scenario B**: The individual focuses on the RELATIVE COMPARISON of their raise against what others received

3. **Determine Motivation Mode**:
   - **IF Scenario A (Absolute Sum)**: The employee is motivated by Physiological or Safety needs
     - Money is viewed as a utilitarian resource to buy necessities
     - Motivation ceases once the specific monetary target is met
     - Example: Caribbean plant workers quitting after reaching a savings goal
   - **IF Scenario B (Relative Comparison)**: The employee is motivated by Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization
     - Money is viewed as a "measure of achievement" rather than a utilitarian need
     - Motivation is boundless; the "second ten million" is just as important as the first
     - Example: Venture Capitalists driven by achievement scores

### Interpretation

- **Lower Levels (Physiological/Safety)**: Money satisfies a deficit need
- **Upper Levels (Esteem/Self-Actualization)**: Money satisfies a growth need and serves as a scorecard for success

## Diagnostic Tool 2: Black Box Assessment Methodology

Use this framework to assess a subordinate's performance comprehensively.

### Procedure

1. **Define Expectations**: Clarify in advance what is expected from the subordinate to ensure assessment against standards.

2. **Evaluate Output Measures (The Output of the Black Box)**:
   - Assess tangible results
   - Examples: completing designs, meeting sales quotas, increasing production yield
   - These are items that can be plotted on charts

3. **Evaluate Internal Measures (Inside the Black Box)**:
   - Assess activities creating output for the current period
   - Assess activities setting the stage for future output
   - Examples: positioning/developing people, ensuring department health to prevent future disgruntlement

4. **Determine Weighting**:
   - There is no strict formula for comparing significance
   - Weighting is situational (e.g., 50/50, 90/10, 10/90)
   - Weighting can shift monthly based on priorities

5. **Trade-off Analysis**: Explicitly identify which variables are being traded off against each other in the final assessment.

### When to Use Different Weightings

- **90/10 Output/Internal**: Crisis mode, immediate results needed
- **50/50 Output/Internal**: Balanced approach, steady state
- **10/90 Output/Internal**: Investment mode, building for future

## Procedure

### Step 1: Select the Appropriate Diagnostic Tool
- Use Money Motivation Test when analyzing compensation reactions
- Use Black Box Assessment when evaluating overall performance

### Step 2: Apply the Tool
- Follow the specific steps for the chosen tool
- Gather objective data and observations
- Document findings

### Step 3: Interpret Results
- What do the results indicate about the individual's motivation?
- What level of Maslow's hierarchy is driving behavior?
- How does performance compare to expectations?

### Step 4: Determine Action
- Based on diagnosis, what interventions are needed?
- Are there performance issues to address?
- Are there motivation opportunities to leverage?

## Key Considerations

- **Objectivity**: Strive for objective assessment, especially with Black Box methodology
- **Context**: Consider the individual's role, experience, and circumstances
- **Patterns**: Look for patterns over time, not single data points
- **Cultural Factors**: Cultural differences may affect what is considered "expected level" of compensation

## Output

- **Money Motivation Test**: Employee is operating in [Motivation Mode] where money acts as [Utilitarian Resource OR Measure of Achievement]
- **Black Box Assessment**: A balanced performance score based on weighted output and internal measures
