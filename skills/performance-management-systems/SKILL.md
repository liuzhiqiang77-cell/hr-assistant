# Performance Management Systems

## When to Use
- Seeking to improve team performance, motivation, or engagement
- Creating a competitive work environment
- Conducting performance assessments for subordinates
- Establishing measurable performance indicators

## Competitive Sports Management Approach

### 1. Establish the "Racetrack" (Arena of Competition)
- Create clear "rules of the game" for the work environment
- Implement specific metrics or scores for peer comparison
- Example: Assign "building czar" to score facility maintenance across buildings

### 2. Define Manager's Role as "The Coach"
- Take NO personal credit for team success to build trust
- Be tough and critical to push team members to "personal best"
- Steer employees toward task-relevant feedback (performance reviews), not irrelevant rewards (office size)

### 3. Manage Fear and Failure
- **Fear Shift**: From "loss of job" to "fear of failure"
- **Positive Use**: Allow fear of failure to spur performance
- **Negative Prevention**: Prevent fear from causing conservative risk-avoidance
- **Normalize Failure**: Losing is a statistical probability (e.g., 50% of matches), not a reason to quit

### 4. Maintain Competitive Environment
- Monitor for removal of competition (e.g., mergers) which causes motivation to vanish
- Ensure the "game" remains active to sustain self-sustaining motivation

## Black Box Assessment Methodology

### 1. Define Expectations
Clarify in advance what is expected from the subordinate

### 2. Evaluate Output Measures (The Output of the Black Box)
- Assess tangible results (designs completed, sales quotas met, production yield increased)
- Items that can be plotted on charts

### 3. Evaluate Internal Measures (Inside the Black Box)
- Activities creating output for the current period
- Activities setting the stage for future output:
  - Positioning/developing people
  - Ensuring department health to prevent future disgruntlement

### 4. Determine Weighting
- No strict formula; weighting is situational
- Can shift monthly (e.g., 50/50, 90/10, 10/90)

### 5. Trade-off Analysis
Explicitly identify which variables are being traded off against each other

## Implementation Steps
1. **Choose Approach**: Decide between competitive sports model, black box assessment, or both
2. **Set Up Metrics**: Establish clear performance indicators and scoring systems
3. **Define Roles**: Clarify manager as coach, not credit-taker
4. **Conduct Assessments**: Use balanced approach of output and internal measures
5. **Maintain Environment**: Keep competitive elements active and normalize failure
