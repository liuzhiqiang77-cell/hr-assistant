# Hiring Strategy and Reference Checks

Use this skill when you need to develop a hiring strategy, check references, or analyze interview results to make a hiring decision.

## When to Use
- You have completed an initial interview with a candidate
- You have a list of references to contact
- You need to plan your overall interview and hiring strategy
- You are conducting post-interview analysis

## Strategic Principles

### 1. Define the Ultimate Purpose

The goal of interviewing is to:
- Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance
- Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit

### 2. Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks

**Do Not Use Tricks:**
- Avoid gimmicks like the "three-legged chair" to test character
- These create wrong first impressions that take a long time to change if hired

**Be Straightforward:**
- Show yourself and the environment as they really are
- Remember: a candidate is a potential employee, not a test subject

### 3. Execute Reference Checking

**Goal:** Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.

**Rapport Building:**
- If you know the reference personally, you have a better chance of getting "real" information
- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

**Timing:**
- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond

### 4. Conduct Follow-up Interviews

If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references:
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from reference checks
- Clarify any discrepancies or concerns

### 5. Acknowledge Limitations

Recognize that:
- Careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- It merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well
- There is always a risk of failure in hiring decisions

## Output

The process produces a hiring decision based on:
- Comprehensive assessment of candidate potential
- Reference verification
- Strategic fit analysis
- Acknowledgment of inherent risks
