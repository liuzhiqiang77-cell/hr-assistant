## Trade-off Examples

**Scenario 1**: Accepting lower output to build capability
- "John's output was 80% of target, but he spent 30% of time training new hires. This investment will pay off next quarter when team capacity increases."

**Scenario 2**: Prioritizing output over development
- "Maria hit 120% of target but didn't mentor her team. We need to address this balance before promoting her."

**Scenario 3**: High internal contribution, low output
- "Alex's internal contributions are exceptional (process improvements, team building), but output is lagging. We need to translate this foundation into results."
