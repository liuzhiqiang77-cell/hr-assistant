# Weighting Guidelines for Black Box Assessment

## Role-Based Weighting Ranges

| Role Type | Output Weight | Internal Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Sales / Business Development | 70-90% | 10-30% | Results directly measurable and critical |
| Individual Contributor (Junior) | 60-80% | 20-40% | Learning while contributing |
| Individual Contributor (Senior) | 50-70% | 30-50% | Expected to contribute beyond tasks |
| Team Lead | 40-60% | 40-60% | Balance of delivery and enablement |
| Manager | 30-50% | 50-70% | Success through others |
| Senior Manager / Director | 20-40% | 60-80% | Strategic and organizational impact |
| Executive | 10-30% | 70-90% | Organizational health and strategy |

## Context-Based Adjustments

**Increase Output Weight When**:
- Crisis or urgent deadline
- Performance improvement plan
- Probationary period
- Quarter-end / year-end push
- Role transition (learning new skills)

**Increase Internal Weight When**:
- New role or promotion
- Team building phase
- Turnaround situation
- Organizational change
- Leadership development
- Strategic planning period

## Time-Based Weighting Shifts

**New Employee (0-90 days)**:
- Start: 20% Output / 80% Internal (learning, building relationships)
- Mid: 40% Output / 60% Internal (taking on work)
- End: 60% Output / 40% Internal (contributing independently)

**Established Employee**:
- Standard: 50-70% Output / 30-50% Internal
- Development phase: Shift toward internal
- Performance push: Shift toward output

**Promotion Candidate**:
- Should show strength in both dimensions
- Weighting reflects target role, not current role
- Look for evidence of next-level internal contributions

## Common Pitfalls

**Over-weighting Output**:
- Short-termism at expense of long-term health
- Discourages mentoring and team building
- Favors individual heroics over sustainable systems

**Over-weighting Internal**:
- Excuses poor performance
- Lack of accountability for results
- "Busy work" without impact

**Inconsistent Weighting**:
- Changing criteria without communication
- Applying different standards to similar roles
- Not explaining rationale to employee

## Best Practices

1. **Communicate weighting upfront**: Employee should know how they'll be evaluated
2. **Document rationale**: Why this weighting for this context?
3. **Be consistent**: Apply similar logic to similar situations
4. **Explain trade-offs**: Make the balancing act explicit
5. **Review periodically**: Does weighting still make sense?
6. **Calibrate across team**: Ensure fairness in application
