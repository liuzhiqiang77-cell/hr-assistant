# Performance Black Box Assessment

## When to Use
- Conducting performance reviews for subordinates
- Evaluating employee contributions over a review period
- Making promotion or compensation decisions
- Assessing both current output and future potential
- Balancing tangible results with intangible contributions

## Core Concept
The Black Box model treats the employee as a "black box" where you assess both:
1. **Output Measures**: What comes out of the box (tangible results)
2. **Internal Measures**: What happens inside the box (activities creating current and future value)

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Define Expectations
Before assessment, clarify what is expected from the subordinate. Ensure assessment is against pre-defined standards, not arbitrary criteria.

### Step 2: Evaluate Output Measures
Assess tangible results that can be plotted on charts:
- Completed designs or deliverables
- Sales quotas met or exceeded
- Production yield improvements
- Projects delivered on time/budget
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Revenue generated
- Cost savings achieved

**Characteristics**:
- Quantitative and measurable
- Directly attributable to the employee
- Time-bound to the review period
- Visible and verifiable

### Step 3: Evaluate Internal Measures
Assess activities that may not have immediate visible output but create value:

**Current Period Activities**:
- Activities creating output for current period
- Supporting team members
- Process improvements
- Problem-solving

**Future-Building Activities**:
- Positioning and developing people
- Ensuring department health
- Preventing future disgruntlement
- Knowledge sharing and documentation
- Building relationships
- Strategic thinking and planning

**Characteristics**:
- Qualitative and often intangible
- May not have immediate visible results
- Critical for long-term organizational health
- Harder to measure precisely

### Step 4: Determine Weighting
There is no strict formula. Weighting is situational and can shift over time.

**Common Weighting Scenarios**:
- **50/50**: Balanced emphasis on results and building
- **90/10**: Results-critical period (e.g., sales role in quarter-end)
- **10/90**: Development or turnaround phase (e.g., new manager building team)

**Factors Influencing Weighting**:
- Role and level of employee
- Organizational priorities
- Current business context
- Employee's career stage
- Time horizon of evaluation

### Step 5: Trade-off Analysis
Explicitly identify which variables are being traded off:
- "I'm weighting current output at 70% because we need results this quarter"
- "I'm weighting internal measures at 60% because this employee is in development"
- "I'm accepting lower output this month because they're building systems for future efficiency"

## Constraints
- Difficult to apply strictly objectively to professional work
- Internal measures require judgment and observation
- Weighting is subjective and context-dependent
- May be challenging to attribute some outcomes to specific individuals

## Best Practices
- Document expectations before review period
- Gather specific examples for both output and internal measures
- Be transparent about weighting decisions
- Explain trade-offs explicitly
- Use multiple data points and perspectives
- Consider both short-term and long-term impact
