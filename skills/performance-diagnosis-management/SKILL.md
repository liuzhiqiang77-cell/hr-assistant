# Performance Diagnosis and Management

This skill provides tools for diagnosing performance problems and selecting appropriate management approaches based on individual capability and context.

## Performance Diagnosis: Can't vs. Won't

**Use when:** An individual is not performing their job

### The Diagnostic Test

1. **Identify the performance issue**: The person is not doing their job

2. **Apply the "Life or Death" Mental Test**:
   Ask yourself: "If the person's life depended on doing the work, could he do it?"

3. **Evaluate the answer**:
   - **YES**: Person is capable but NOT motivated → **"Won't do it"**
   - **NO**: Person is NOT capable → **"Can't do it"**

4. **Select the managerial intervention**:
   - **Can't do it** (Capability issue): Use **Training**
   - **Won't do it** (Motivation issue): Use **Motivation strategies**

**Critical Insight:** These are the ONLY two reasons a person does not do their job. Everything else is useless unless individuals try to offer their best.

**Note:** Does not apply if root cause is external (e.g., equipment failure, lack of resources).

## Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

**Use when:** Assessing a subordinate's capability to perform a specific task

### Definition

Task-Relevant Maturity is a combination of:
- Degree of achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience

### Key Principles

**TRM is Task-Specific:**
- A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another
- TRM is specific to the task at hand, not general competence

**TRM is Dynamic:**
- Can change day by day or hour by hour
- Can drop if pace accelerates or job abruptly changes
- Even seasoned managers may have low TRM in new environments

**Factors Causing Low TRM:**
- New environment, content, or tasks
- Accelerated pace of work
- Abrupt job changes
- Lack of relevant training/experience

### Assessment Factors

1. **Achievement Orientation** (Qualitative):
   - Degree to which subordinate is driven to achieve
   - Look for initiative, goal-setting behavior

2. **Readiness for Responsibility** (Qualitative):
   - Willingness to be accountable for outcomes
   - Look for ownership of results

3. **Experience/Education** (Qualitative):
   - Relevant training and background specific to task
   - Consider both formal education and practical experience

### TRM Levels

- **Low TRM**: Needs detailed instructions, close supervision
- **Medium/Growing TRM**: Needs some guidance, can handle moderate autonomy
- **High TRM**: Needs minimal supervision, can handle full autonomy

## Competitive Sports Management Approach

**Use when:** Seeking to improve performance, motivation, or engagement of a team

### Core Concept

Treat the workplace as a competitive sports arena where:
- Clear rules and metrics exist
- Performance is measurable and comparable
- Manager acts as coach, not dictator
- Failure is normalized as part of improvement

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Establish the "Racetrack" (Arena of Competition)

- Create clear "rules of the game" for the work environment
- Implement specific metrics or scores for self-measurement against peers
- **Example**: Assign "building czar" to score facility maintenance and compare across buildings
- Result: Immediate improvement without monetary rewards

#### 2. Define Manager's Role as "The Coach"

- **Take NO personal credit** for team's success (builds trust)
- Be **tough and critical** to push team to "personal best"
- Steer employees away from irrelevant rewards (office size, perks)
- Focus on **task-relevant feedback** (performance reviews, metrics)

#### 3. Manage Fear and Failure

**Recognize Fear Shift:**
- In competitive mode, fear shifts from "loss of job" to "fear of failure"

**Positive Use of Fear:**
- Allow fear of failure to spur performance
- Use it as motivation to prepare and perform

**Prevent Negative Effects:**
- Stop fear from becoming preoccupation that causes conservative risk-avoidance
- Don't let fear paralyze decision-making

**Normalize Failure:**
- Adopt sports mindset: losing is statistical probability (e.g., 50% of matches)
- Failure is NOT reason to quit
- Failure is data for improvement

#### 4. Maintain Competitive Environment

- Monitor for removal of competition (e.g., mergers eliminate benchmarks)
- Ensure "game" remains active to sustain self-sustaining motivation
- Refresh metrics and challenges periodically

### Key Variables

- **performance_metrics**: Scores or indicators used for comparison (Quantitative)
- **competition_status**: Whether competitive benchmark exists (Binary)

## Integrating the Approaches

### Diagnostic Workflow

1. **Observe Performance Issue**
2. **Apply Can't vs. Won't Test**
   - If Can't → Assess TRM to determine training needs
   - If Won't → Consider motivation strategies (may use Competitive Sports approach)
3. **Assess TRM**
   - Low TRM → Provide detailed instructions, close supervision
   - Medium TRM → Provide guidance, moderate autonomy
   - High TRM → Provide autonomy, minimal supervision
4. **Select Management Style**
   - For teams needing engagement → Implement Competitive Sports approach
   - For individuals needing development → Adjust based on TRM

### TRM-Based Management Style

| TRM Level | Management Style | Supervision | Decision-Making |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Low | Directive | Close | Manager makes decisions |
| Medium | Coaching | Moderate | Joint decisions |
| High | Delegative | Minimal | Subordinate makes decisions |

### Combining with Competitive Sports

- **Low TRM individuals**: May need protected environment before full competition
- **Medium TRM individuals**: Benefit from competitive metrics with coaching
- **High TRM individuals**: Thrive in competitive environment with autonomy

## Key Variables

- **life_dependent_capability**: Could person perform task if life depended on it? (Boolean)
- **Achievement Orientation**: Degree to which subordinate is driven to achieve (Qualitative)
- **Readiness for Responsibility**: Willingness to be accountable (Qualitative)
- **Experience/Education**: Relevant training and background (Qualitative)
- **performance_metrics**: Scores for comparison (Quantitative)
- **competition_status**: Whether competitive benchmark exists (Binary)

## Expected Outcomes

- **Can't vs. Won't**: Root cause identified as [Capability] requiring Training or [Motivation] requiring strategies
- **TRM Assessment**: Task-Relevant Maturity Level (Low, Medium/Growing, High) specific to current task
- **Competitive Sports**: Implement scoring system, adopt coach persona, normalize failure to elicit peak performance
- **Integrated Approach**: Appropriate management style matched to individual capability and team context
