# Hiring Strategy and Reference Protocol

Execute a comprehensive hiring approach that includes strategic interviewing, thorough reference checks, and realistic acknowledgment of limitations.

## When to Use
- Planning overall interview strategy before candidate interactions
- Conducting reference checks after initial interviews
- Performing follow-up interviews with candidates
- Conducting post-interview analysis and decision-making

## Core Strategic Principles

### 1. Define the Ultimate Purpose
- **Primary Goal**: Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance
- **Approach**: Move between the world of the past employer and your own organization to assess fit
- **Focus**: Use past behavior and performance as the best predictor of future results

### 2. Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks
- **No Manipulation**: Do not use psychological tricks or gimmicks (e.g., three-legged chair tests) to assess character
- **Complete Straightforwardness**: Show yourself and the environment as they really are
- **Rationale**: A candidate is a potential employee; wrong first impressions take significant time to correct if they are hired
- **Authenticity**: Present the role and organization truthfully to ensure mutual fit

### 3. Execute Reference Checking Protocol

**Goal**: Obtain the same information you attempted to get from the candidate directly, verified by third parties.

**Build Rapport**:
- If you know the reference personally: Leverage the existing relationship to obtain candid information
- If the reference is a stranger:
  - Keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
  - Uncover common experiences or associations to increase openness
  - The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes

**Maximize Information Quality**:
- Allocate sufficient time for each reference call
- Build personal connection before asking sensitive questions
- Cross-reference information obtained from the candidate

### 4. Conduct Follow-up Interviews
- If possible, schedule a second conversation with the applicant after checking references
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from reference checks
- Clarify discrepancies or areas of concern discovered during the reference process
- Allow the candidate to respond to feedback from their references

### 5. Acknowledge Limitations Realistically
- **No Guarantee**: Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee hiring success
- **Probability Enhancement**: The process merely increases the odds of making a good hire
- **Risk Acceptance**: Accept that some element of luck remains in any hiring decision
- **Continuous Improvement**: Use outcomes to refine future interview and reference processes

## Output
Generate:
- Strategic hiring plan aligned with realistic expectations
- Comprehensive reference check summaries
- Risk-assessed hiring recommendations
- Clear acknowledgment of decision uncertainty
