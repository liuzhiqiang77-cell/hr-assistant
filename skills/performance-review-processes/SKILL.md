# Performance Review Processes

Apply specialized review processes tailored to specific performance situations and employee types.

## When to Use

- An employee has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing
- An employee is a high achiever who could perform even better
- You need to guide an employee through resistance to change

## The 'Blast' Process (Turnaround Reviews)

Use when a subordinate is at risk of termination unless performance improves.

### Identify the Resistance Stage

Track the subordinate's current stage:
1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation

### Facilitate Progression

1. **Move from Ignore to Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
2. **Move from Deny to Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance
3. **Move to Assume Responsibility**: Guide the subordinate to take ownership
   - This is the critical emotional step
   - The subordinate realizes: "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
4. **Move to Find Solution**: Once responsibility is assumed, finding solutions is a shared intellectual task

### Possible Outcomes

1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (If stuck at 'Blame Others')

1. Assume the formal role of supervisor with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do"
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way"
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am empowered and required by the organization to give you instructions"
5. Secure commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

Use when the subordinate is a high performer who could improve further.

### Identify the Problem

- High achievers often receive reviews that are purely retrospective assessments
- Supervisors spend effort justifying superior performance while giving little attention to future improvement
- Poor performers often get detailed corrective action programs, while high achievers lack future-oriented guidance

### Shift the Priority

1. Move beyond justifying the high rating
2. Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to improve performance
3. Define specific actions to maintain current high performance level
4. Remember: High achievers account for disproportionately large share of work
5. Improving high achievers is a "high-leverage activity" with great impact on group output

### Key Principle

High achievers deserve the same level of detailed, future-oriented guidance as poor performers—but focused on excellence rather than minimum requirements.
