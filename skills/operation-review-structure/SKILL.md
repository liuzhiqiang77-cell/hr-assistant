# Operation Review Structure and Roles

## When to Use
- Interaction needed between employees several organizational levels apart who don't usually meet
- Topics require cross-level teaching/learning
- Medium for presenters to impress supervisors' supervisors and peers is desired
- Junior managers need detailed feedback from senior management

## Do Not Use When
- Immediate supervisor-subordinate one-on-ones
- Routine staff meetings

## Purpose
Facilitate teaching and learning between organizational levels that lack regular one-on-ones or staff meetings. This provides motivation for presenters to perform at their best.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Organizing Manager (Supervisor)
- Decide what issues to discuss, emphasize, and the level of detail
- Handle housekeeping (room, visuals, invitations)
- Act as timekeeper: Schedule presentations and keep them moving using inconspicuous gestures to prevent running out of time

### Reviewing Manager (Senior Supervisor)
- Ask questions, make comments, and impart the appropriate spirit
- Act as a catalyst to provoke audience participation and encourage free expression by example
- **NEVER preview the material** to ensure spontaneous reaction
- Take the role seriously as a model for junior managers

### Presenters
- Use visual aids (overhead transparencies) to engage eyes and ears simultaneously
- **Rule of Thumb**: Allow four minutes of presentation and discussion time per visual aid (tables, numbers, graphics)
- Highlight emphasis using a color pen or pointer
- Monitor the audience "like a hawk" using facial expressions and body language to adjust speed or clarify points

### Audience
- Participate actively by asking questions and making comments
- Avoid disengagement behaviors (avoiding eyes, yawning, reading newspaper) as this undermines presenter confidence
- Correct factual errors publicly (it is your responsibility)
- Regard attendance as work, not a "siesta"

## Time Management Formula
Calculate presentation time: `visual_aids_count × 4 minutes`

## Expected Outcome
Junior managers receive detailed feedback, and senior managers gain comprehensive problem insights through active engagement.
