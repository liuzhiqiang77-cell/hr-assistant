name: Performance Indicator Systems
description: Use this skill when designing performance metrics, monitoring daily operations, or tracking progress toward monthly goals. Apply to create paired indicators that prevent overreaction, measure output rather than activity, conduct daily operational reviews, and use linearity analysis for early warning signals before deadlines.

# Performance Indicator Systems

## When to Use
- Designing or selecting performance metrics for a team or process
- Starting daily operations and need a review checklist
- Monitoring progress toward a deadline or monthly target
- Preventing over-optimization of a single metric
- Establishing objective performance standards

## Design Effective Indicators

### Apply the Attention Principle

Recognize that indicators direct attention like steering a bicycle: 'you will probably steer it where you are looking.'

### Guard Against Overreaction

Be aware that focusing on a single metric can lead to extreme behaviors.

**Example:** Driving inventory too low creates shortages.

### Implement Paired Indicators

Always pair indicators to measure both the 'effect' and the 'counter-effect' to maintain the 'optimum middle ground.'

**Examples:**
- Pair 'Inventory Levels' with 'Incidence of Shortages'
- Pair 'Completion Date' with 'Capability' (avoids rushing or perfectionism)
- Pair '# Vouchers processed' with '# Errors found'
- Pair '# Square feet cleaned' with 'Quality rating by senior manager'

### Follow Administrative Indicator Criteria

**Rule 1:** Any measurement is better than none.

**Rule 2:** Measure **Output** (results), not **Activity** (effort)
- Measure orders obtained, not calls made
- Measure graduates hired, not interviews conducted

**Rule 3:** Measure **Physical/Countable** things
- Examples: Vouchers processed, square feet cleaned, sales orders entered, transactions processed, people hired, items managed

## Conduct Daily Operational Review

### 1. Review Sales Forecast
Determine number of units planned for delivery today.

### 2. Analyze Variance
Compare yesterday's actual deliveries against yesterday's planned deliveries to assess confidence in today's forecast.

### 3. Check Raw Material Inventory
Verify stock levels of essential items.
- **IF inventory is too low:** Order more supplies immediately
- **IF inventory is too high:** Cancel scheduled deliveries

### 4. Assess Equipment Condition
Check if any equipment broke down yesterday.
- **IF breakdown occurred:** Arrange repairs or rearrange production line to meet forecast

### 5. Evaluate Manpower
Check staff availability.
- **IF understaffed:** Call in temporary help OR reallocate staff from other lines

### 6. Monitor Quality Indicator
Review customer complaint log.
- **IF a staff member elicited unusual complaints:** Speak to that person immediately

## Track Progress with Linearity Analysis

### Plot Actual vs. Ideal

1. Plot actual output achieved against time elapsed (e.g., acceptances vs. month)
2. Define 'Ideal Straight Line': Linear trajectory from starting point to final target at deadline

### Compare and Interpret

**Scenario A - Below the Line:**
- Example: Recruiting in April vs. June target
- Calculate required rate for remaining period
- Indicator signals much higher rate needed in remaining months
- **Action:** Take immediate corrective action to accelerate performance

**Scenario B - Back-Loaded:**
- Output concentrated in last week rather than spread evenly
- Indicates inefficient use of manpower/equipment
- **Action:** Address resource allocation to prevent missing goals due to potential breakdowns

### Purpose
Provides an 'early warning' to allow time for corrective action before deadline passes.

### Success Factor
Requires belief in indicator validity to take corrective action when deviation occurs.
