# Motivation Context Differences

## Manual Labor vs Knowledge Workers

### Manual Labor
- **Output**: Readily measurable (units produced, tasks completed)
- **Expectations**: Can be stated precisely
- **Historical Approach**: Fear of punishment (loss of life/food) worked well
- **Example**: Galley slaves driven by fear

### Knowledge Workers
- **Output**: Difficult to measure immediately
- **Expectations**: Hard to state precisely
- **Fear Limitation**: "Fear won't work as well with computer architects as with galley slaves"
- **Required Approach**: New humanistic approaches needed

## Why Fear Fails with Knowledge Workers
1. Creativity requires psychological safety
2. Complex problem-solving needs cognitive freedom
3. Innovation requires risk-taking, which fear suppresses
4. Knowledge work often involves collaboration, which fear undermines
