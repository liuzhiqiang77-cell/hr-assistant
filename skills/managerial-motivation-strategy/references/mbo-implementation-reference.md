# MBO (Management by Objectives) Implementation Guide

## Goal Setting Principles

### The 50% Rule
Set objectives at a difficulty level where the individual has only a "fifty-fifty chance" of success, even with maximum effort.

**Why this works:**
- Forces stretching beyond current capability
- Maximizes output even when failure occurs
- Creates engagement through meaningful challenge
- Aligns with achievement-driven motivation

**Implementation steps:**
1. Assess current capability level
2. Identify next performance tier
3. Set goal at boundary of capability
4. Ensure goal is specific and measurable
5. Establish timeline for achievement

### Common Mistakes
- **Too easy**: No motivation, minimal growth
- **Too hard**: Demotivation, learned helplessness
- **Vague**: Cannot measure success or failure
- **Short-term**: Focuses on immediate vs sustainable performance

### Review Cycle
1. **Quarterly**: Assess progress toward objectives
2. **Adjust**: Calibrate difficulty based on performance
3. **Learn**: Analyze failures for improvement insights
4. **Reset**: Establish new challenging goals
