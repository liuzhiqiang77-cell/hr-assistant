# Management by Objectives (MBO) Implementation

## Goal Setting Framework

### The 50% Success Probability Rule

**Rationale**: 
- Output tends to be greater when striving for a level beyond immediate grasp
- Even with 50% failure rate, total output exceeds easy goals
- Forces individuals to work at their "boundary of capability"

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Assess individual's current capability level
2. Identify objectives just beyond current reach
3. Verify objective requires maximum effort to achieve
4. Set success probability at approximately 50%
5. Monitor progress and adjust as capability grows

**Example**:
- Current capability: 100 units/week consistently
- Easy goal: 110 units/week (90% success probability)
- Optimal MBO goal: 125 units/week (50% success probability)
- Expected outcome: Average of 115-120 units/week (higher than easy goal)

### Distinguishing Driver Types

**Competence-Driven Employees**:
- **Focus**: Mastery of specific job or task
- **Behavior**: 
  - Sharpening own skills continuously
  - Trying to do better than previous attempts
  - Deep focus on craft/technique
- **Management Approach**:
  - Provide opportunities for skill development
  - Set mastery-based goals
  - Recognize technical excellence
- **Examples**: Craftsmen, artists, technical specialists

**Achievement-Driven Employees**:
- **Focus**: Abstract need to achieve across all endeavors
- **Behavior**:
  - Testing limits of capability
  - Working at boundary of ability
  - Seeking challenges in multiple areas
- **Management Approach**:
  - Provide diverse challenges
  - Set stretch goals across domains
  - Recognize achievement broadly
- **Examples**: Entrepreneurs, high-performing executives, athletes

## Culture Design

### Output-Centered Culture Characteristics
- Tangible results are highly valued and esteemed
- Abstract knowledge without application gets little recognition
- "What have you produced?" is the key question
- Performance is visible and comparable
- Success is measured by outcomes, not intentions

### Knowledge-Centered Culture Characteristics (Avoid)
- Knowing abstractly is valued over producing results
- Credentials and expertise matter more than output
- "What do you know?" is the key question
- Theoretical understanding trumps practical application
- Success is measured by status, not results

**Transition Strategy**:
1. Identify current cultural norms
2. Begin measuring and publicizing output metrics
3. Reward tangible results visibly
4. Shift recognition from credentials to accomplishments
5. Lead by example—focus on your own output
