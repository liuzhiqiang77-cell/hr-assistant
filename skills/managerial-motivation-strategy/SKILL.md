# Managerial Motivation Strategy

## When to Use
- Managing knowledge workers where output is difficult to measure
- Improving team performance when the root cause is motivation (not capability)
- Transitioning from fear-based management to humanistic approaches
- Creating a self-sustaining motivation system

## Core Philosophy

### The Manager's Role
- **Cannot**: Directly motivate another person or force internal drive
- **Can**: Create an environment where motivated people can flourish
- **Focus**: Environmental design, not attitude manipulation

### Success Definition
- **Desired Result**: Better performance at a given skill level
- **NOT Desired**: Change of attitude or feeling
- **Attitude Role**: Merely an indicator (a "window into the black box"), not the goal

### Contextual Approach
- **Manual Labor**: Output is measurable; fear of punishment historically worked
- **Knowledge Workers**: Output is hard to measure; fear won't work; humanistic approaches required

## Implementation: Competitive Sports Approach

### Step 1: Establish the Arena of Competition
1. Create clear "rules of the game" for the work environment
2. Implement specific metrics or scores for peer comparison
3. Example: Assign a "building czar" to score facility maintenance and compare across buildings

### Step 2: Adopt the Coach Persona
1. Take NO personal credit for team success (builds trust)
2. Be tough and critical to push team members to personal best
3. Steer employees toward task-relevant feedback (performance reviews), not irrelevant rewards (office size)

### Step 3: Manage Fear and Failure
1. **Shift Fear**: From "loss of job" to "fear of failure"
2. **Positive Use**: Allow fear of failure to spur performance
3. **Negative Prevention**: Prevent fear from causing conservative risk-avoidance
4. **Normalize Failure**: Losing is a statistical probability (e.g., 50% of matches), not a reason to quit

### Step 4: Maintain the Competitive Environment
1. Monitor for removal of competition (e.g., mergers) which causes motivation to vanish
2. Ensure the "game" remains active to sustain self-sustaining motivation

## Constraints
- Requires a culture that accepts feedback
- May not work if competition leads to destructive behavior
- Assumes basic physiological and safety needs are met

## Output
A strategy focused on environmental design and performance measurement rather than attitude manipulation, utilizing competitive principles to elicit peak performance.
