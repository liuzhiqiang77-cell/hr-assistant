# Candidate Interviewing and Evaluation

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- You are preparing to interview a job candidate
- You are conducting an interview session
- You need to check candidate references
- You are making a hiring decision
- You are analyzing interview outcomes

## Core Principles

### Maintain Honesty
- Do not use tricks or gimmicks to test character
- Show yourself and the environment as they really are
- Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired

### Define the Ultimate Purpose
- Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance
- Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit

## Conducting the Interview

### 1. Ask Specific Recommended Questions

Assess the candidate with these key questions:

- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

### 2. Categorize the Inquiries

Ensure coverage across these categories:

- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, weaknesses
- **What They Did With Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures
- **Discrepancies**: Learning from failures, problems in current position
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new job, why the company should hire them

### 3. Utilize Direct Questions

- Ask blunt questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?") to elicit direct answers
- Observe the candidate's reaction and the confidence/timidity of the response
- Gauge actual capability through their response style

### 4. Employ Hypothetical Situations

- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job
- Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result
- Discover their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly

### 5. Invite Candidate Questions

- Ask the candidate what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job
- Analyze their questions to determine:
  - What they already know
  - What they value
  - How prepared they are

## Reference Checking Protocol

### Goal
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.

### Build Rapport

- **If you know the reference personally**: You have a better chance of getting 'real' information
- **If the reference is a stranger**: Keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- **Try to uncover common experience or association** to increase openness

### Timing Considerations
- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes
- This is due to the bond developed over time

## Follow-up Interviews

- If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks

## Making the Hiring Decision

### Acknowledge Limitations
- Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- Accept that it merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well

### Evaluate Based On
- Candidate's skills and technical capability
- Operational values and cultural fit
- Problem-solving capacity
- Reference verification results
- Overall potential contribution in your environment

## Constraints

- Limited time (typically an hour or two for interviews)
- Candidate may provide self-assessment that is biased
- High risk of failure in hiring decisions
- No guarantee of success regardless of process quality
