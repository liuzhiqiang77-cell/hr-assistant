# Manager-Led Training Strategy

## Core Principle: Manager's Output Definition

A manager's output is strictly defined as "the output of his organization—no more, no less."

To increase individual performance, utilize two principal means:
1. Increasing motivation (desire to do the job well)
2. Increasing individual capability (via training)

**Key Insight**: Just as motivation cannot be fully delegated, neither should training be delegated solely to specialists.

## Assign the Trainer Role

### Who Should Train?

- **The manager (you)** must instruct direct subordinates and the next few ranks below them
- **Rationale**: Training must be performed by a "suitable role model" who is a "believable, practicing authority"
- **Constraint**: Proxies, regardless of subject matter expertise, cannot fill this role effectively

### Curriculum Scope Benchmark

- Maintain a catalogue of courses (e.g., Intel's "university catalogue" with 50+ classes)
- Cover range from basic skills (telephone manners) to complex technical skills (ion implanter operation requiring ~200 hours)
- Include management disciplines (strategic planning, "constructive confrontation", performance reviews, productive meetings)
- **Target**: Allocate approximately **2% to 4% of employee time** to classroom learning

## Classify the Training Task

### Task 1: New Member Training
- Teaching new members the skills needed to perform their jobs

### Task 2: New Skill Training
- Teaching new ideas, principles, or skills to present members

## Calculate Training Volume

### Task 1 Volume Formula

```
Annual Training Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)
```

**Example**: A department with 10% turnover and 10% growth must train 20% of its staff annually.

### Task 2 Volume Calculation

- **Target**: 100% of the staff
- **Comparison Formula**: `Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load`
- **Example**: If Task 1 load is 20%, Task 2 is 5 times larger (100% / 20%)

### Cost and Feasibility Evaluation

- **Cost Benchmark**: A one-day course for middle-management staff can cost over $1,000,000 in student time alone
- **Decision Rule**: Do not enter into Task 2 (training all staff) lightly due to high magnitude and cost

## Execute High-Leverage Training (ROI Calculation)

### Preparation Standard

- Allocate **3 hours of preparation** for every 1 hour of course time

### ROI Example Scenario

1. **Preparation**: 4 lectures × 3 hours prep = 12 hours total manager time
2. **Scale**: Train 10 students
3. **Impact Baseline**: Students will work approximately 20,000 hours total next year
4. **Result**: If training yields a 1% performance improvement, the organization gains 200 hours of work (1% of 20,000) for a 12-hour investment

### ROI Formula

```
Hours Gained = (Total Student Hours × Performance Improvement %) - Manager Preparation Time
```

## Ensure Cultural Alignment

- **Avoid** "highly structured and academic" approaches if they contradict company practices
- **Example**: If company tradition is a "free market" where employees apply for jobs on their own initiative, do not teach "carefully coordinated job rotations" or long-term career plans
- **Warning**: Mismatch between teaching and practice demoralizes participants

## Maintain Consistency: Process vs. Event

- Training must be a "**process, not an event**"
- Provide a "reliable, consistent presence" that is "systematic and scheduled"
- **Do NOT** use training as a "rescue effort summoned to solve the problem of the moment"

## Mitigate Risks of Insufficient Training

### Consequences of Training Gaps

- Inefficiencies
- Excess costs
- Unhappy customers
- Danger (safety risks)

### Example Failure

An untrained operator operating an ion implanter caused >$1M in scrapped material and delivery slips.

## When to Use This Skill

- Increasing organizational output through capability building
- Onboarding new employees
- Introducing new skills, processes, or technologies
- Improving performance of specific work groups
- Establishing systematic training programs

## Constraints

- Training content must align with company culture
- Training must not be a one-time "rescue effort"
- Proxies cannot assume the role of teacher
- Training must be tied to practice
- Training must be a continuing process

## Variables

- **prep_ratio**: Hours of preparation per hour of course time (standard: 3)
- **total_student_hours**: Total annual work hours of the trained group
- **performance_improvement**: Efficiency gain achieved through training (e.g., 1%)
- **Annual Turnover Rate**: Percentage of staff leaving annually
- **Annual Growth Rate**: Percentage the organization grows annually
