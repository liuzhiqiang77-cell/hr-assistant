## Knowledge Gap Discovery

### Scenario: Teaching "Writing Effective Emails"

**Instructor's Assumption**: "I've been writing emails for 20 years, this will be easy."

**Reality During Preparation**:
- "Wait, what's the actual structure of a good email?"
- "How do I explain when to use CC vs BCC?"
- "I've never thought about why I write subject lines this way"
- "I don't actually know the grammar rules I follow intuitively"

**Outcome**:
- Instructor researches email best practices
- Learns new techniques
- Own emails improve significantly
- **Primary beneficiary**: Instructor
