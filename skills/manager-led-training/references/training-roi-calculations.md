## Training ROI Detailed Calculations

### Example 1: Technical Training for 10 Engineers
**Scenario**: Manager develops 8-hour course on new testing framework

**Investment**:
- Preparation: 8 hours × 3 = 24 hours
- Delivery: 8 hours
- Total Manager Time: 32 hours

**Students**:
- 10 engineers
- Annual work time: 10 × 2,000 = 20,000 hours

**Return**:
- If training reduces debugging time by 2%: 20,000 × 0.02 = 400 hours saved
- ROI: 400 hours saved ÷ 32 hours invested = 12.5:1

### Example 2: Management Training for 20 Managers
**Scenario**: Manager develops 16-hour course on performance reviews

**Investment**:
- Preparation: 16 hours × 3 = 48 hours
- Delivery: 16 hours
- Total Manager Time: 64 hours

**Students**:
- 20 managers
- Each manager has 10 direct reports = 200 employees affected
- Annual work time of 200 employees: 200 × 2,000 = 400,000 hours

**Return**:
- If training improves team productivity by 0.5%: 400,000 × 0.005 = 2,000 hours saved
- ROI: 2,000 hours saved ÷ 64 hours invested = 31:1

### Example 3: Company-Wide Training Cost Analysis
**Scenario**: Consider 1-day training for all 500 middle managers

**Student Time Cost**:
- 500 managers × 8 hours = 4,000 hours
- Average hourly cost: $250
- Total cost: 4,000 × $250 = $1,000,000

**Additional Costs**:
- Preparation time (multiple trainers)
- Materials, facilities
- Opportunity cost of time away from work

**Total**: Likely $1.5M - $2M

**Decision**: Only proceed if expected ROI justifies significant investment

## Training Volume Planning Example

### Company Profile
- 1,000 employees
- 15% annual turnover
- 10% annual growth

### Task 1 Load (New Members)
- Training Load = 15% + 10% = 25%
- Employees requiring training: 1,000 × 0.25 = 250 employees

### Task 2 Magnitude (New Skills)
- Magnitude = 100% ÷ 25% = 4x
- Training all staff is 4 times larger than training new members
- Employees requiring training: 1,000 employees

### Resource Planning
- If Task 1 requires 2 trainers, Task 2 requires 8 trainers
- If Task 1 costs $250K, Task 2 costs $1M

**Decision**: Task 2 is feasible only with sufficient resources and clear business need
