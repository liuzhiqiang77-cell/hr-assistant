# Training Formulas and Calculations

## ROI Calculation Formula

```
Total Student Hours = Number of Students × Annual Work Hours per Student
Performance Gain = Total Student Hours × Performance Improvement Percentage
ROI = Performance Gain / Manager Preparation Time
```

### Example Calculation
- Manager Preparation: 12 hours (4 lectures × 3 hours prep)
- Students: 10
- Annual Work Hours per Student: 2,000
- Total Student Hours: 20,000
- Performance Improvement: 1%
- Performance Gain: 200 hours
- ROI: 200 hours gained / 12 hours invested = 16.67x return

## Training Volume Formulas

### Task 1 Load (New Members)
```
Task 1 Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)
```

### Task 2 Magnitude (New Skills)
```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

### Cost Estimation
```
Total Cost = Number of Students × Course Duration × Hourly Cost per Student
```

**Benchmark**: For middle-management staff earning $50/hour, a one-day (8 hour) course costs:
- 20 students × 8 hours × $50 = $8,000 per day
- Or based on opportunity cost of student time
