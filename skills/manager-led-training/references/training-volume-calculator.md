# Training Volume Calculator

## Step-by-Step Calculation

### Step 1: Gather Organizational Data

| Metric | Your Organization |
|--------|-------------------|
| Total employees | |
| Annual turnover rate | % |
| Annual growth rate | % |
| Average employee hours/year | ~2,000 |

### Step 2: Calculate Task 1 Load (New Member Training)

```
Task 1 Load = Turnover Rate + Growth Rate
```

**Example**:
- Turnover: 15%
- Growth: 5%
- Task 1 Load: 20%

### Step 3: Calculate Task 1 Training Hours

```
Task 1 Hours = Total Employees × Task 1 Load × Training Hours Per New Hire
```

**Example**:
- Total employees: 100
- Task 1 Load: 20%
- Training per new hire: 40 hours
- Task 1 Hours: 100 × 0.20 × 40 = 800 hours

### Step 4: Calculate Task 2 Magnitude

```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

**Example**:
- Task 1 Load: 20%
- Task 2 Magnitude: 100 / 20 = 5x

### Step 5: Calculate Task 2 Training Hours

```
Task 2 Hours = Total Employees × Training Hours Per Employee
```

**Example**:
- Total employees: 100
- Training per employee: 8 hours (0.4% of 2,000)
- Task 2 Hours: 100 × 8 = 800 hours

### Step 6: Compare and Prioritize

| Factor | Task 1 | Task 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Target | 20% of staff | 100% of staff |
| Hours | 800 | 800 |
| Magnitude | Baseline | 5x larger |
| Priority | Critical (survival) | Strategic (growth) |

## Cost Calculator

### Student Time Cost

```
Cost = Students × Hours × Fully Burdened Hourly Rate
```

**Example**:
- Students: 50 managers
- Hours: 8 (1-day course)
- Hourly rate: $100 (salary + benefits + overhead)
- Cost: 50 × 8 × 100 = $40,000

### Preparation Time Cost

```
Cost = Prep Hours × Trainer Hourly Rate
```

**Example**:
- Prep ratio: 3:1
- Course hours: 8
- Prep hours: 24
- Trainer rate: $150/hour
- Cost: 24 × 150 = $3,600

### Total Training Cost

```
Total = Student Time Cost + Prep Time Cost + Materials + Facilities
```

**Example**:
- Student time: $40,000
- Prep time: $3,600
- Materials: $2,000
- Facilities: $1,000
- **Total**: $46,600

## ROI Calculator

```
Benefit = Total Student Annual Hours × Performance Improvement %
ROI = Benefit / Total Cost
```

**Example**:
- Students: 50
- Annual hours each: 2,000
- Total hours: 100,000
- Performance improvement: 1%
- Benefit: 1,000 hours
- Value of benefit: 1,000 × $100 = $100,000
- Total cost: $46,600
- **ROI**: 2.15x (215% return)
