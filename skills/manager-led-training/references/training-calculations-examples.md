# Training Calculations and Examples

## ROI Calculation Formula

### Variables
- `prep_ratio`: Hours of preparation per hour of course time (standard: 3)
- `total_student_hours`: Total annual work hours of the trained group
- `performance_improvement`: Efficiency gain achieved through training (e.g., 1%)

### Formula
```
Hours Gained = total_student_hours × performance_improvement
ROI = Hours Gained / (course_hours × prep_ratio)
```

### Example Calculation
- **Preparation**: 4 lectures × 1 hour each × 3 prep ratio = 12 hours manager time
- **Students**: 10 employees
- **Annual Work Hours**: 10 employees × 2,000 hours = 20,000 hours
- **Performance Improvement**: 1%
- **Hours Gained**: 20,000 × 0.01 = 200 hours
- **ROI**: 200 hours gained / 12 hours invested = 16.67x return

## Training Volume Formulas

### Task 1: New Member Training
```
Annual Training Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)
```

**Examples:**
- 10% turnover + 10% growth = 20% of staff needs training
- 5% turnover + 20% growth = 25% of staff needs training
- 15% turnover + 0% growth = 15% of staff needs training

### Task 2: New Skill Training
```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

**Examples:**
- If Task 1 = 20%, Task 2 is 5x larger (100% / 20% = 5)
- If Task 1 = 25%, Task 2 is 4x larger (100% / 25% = 4)
- If Task 1 = 10%, Task 2 is 10x larger (100% / 10% = 10)

## Cost Estimation

### Student Time Cost Formula
```
Total Cost = Number of Students × Course Duration Hours × Hourly Rate
```

### Benchmark Example
- **Course**: One-day training for middle managers
- **Students**: 50 managers
- **Duration**: 8 hours
- **Hourly Rate**: $2,500 (based on $100k annual salary + benefits)
- **Total Cost**: 50 × 8 × $2,500 = $1,000,000

### Cost Comparison
- **Task 1 Cost**: 20% of 50 employees × 8 hours × $2,500 = $200,000
- **Task 2 Cost**: 100% of 50 employees × 8 hours × $2,500 = $1,000,000
- **Difference**: Task 2 costs 5x more than Task 1 in this example
