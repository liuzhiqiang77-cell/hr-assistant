# Training ROI Calculator

## Formula
```
ROI = (Total Performance Gain - Training Cost) / Training Cost

Where:
Total Performance Gain = (Total Student Hours × Performance Improvement %)
Training Cost = (Preparation Hours + Delivery Hours) × Hourly Rate
```

## Example 1: Basic Skills Training

**Scenario:** Manager conducts 2-hour training on effective meetings for 8 team members

**Inputs:**
- Preparation: 3 hours prep per hour training = 6 hours
- Delivery: 2 hours
- Manager hourly rate: $100
- Students: 8
- Annual work hours per student: 2,000
- Total student hours: 16,000
- Expected improvement: 2%

**Calculation:**
- Training Cost: (6 + 2) × $100 = $800
- Performance Gain: 16,000 × 2% = 320 hours
- Value of gain: 320 hours × $100 = $32,000
- ROI: ($32,000 - $800) / $800 = 3,900%

## Example 2: Technical Skills Training

**Scenario:** Manager conducts 8-hour technical training for 12 engineers

**Inputs:**
- Preparation: 3 hours prep per hour training = 24 hours
- Delivery: 8 hours
- Manager hourly rate: $150
- Students: 12
- Annual work hours per student: 2,000
- Total student hours: 24,000
- Expected improvement: 5%

**Calculation:**
- Training Cost: (24 + 8) × $150 = $4,800
- Performance Gain: 24,000 × 5% = 1,200 hours
- Value of gain: 1,200 hours × $150 = $180,000
- ROI: ($180,000 - $4,800) / $4,800 = 3,650%

## Example 3: Large-Scale New Skill Rollout (Task 2)

**Scenario:** Training entire organization (100 people) on new methodology

**Inputs:**
- Preparation: 3 hours prep per hour training = 24 hours
- Delivery: 8 hours per session × 5 sessions = 40 hours
- Manager hourly rate: $200
- Students: 100
- Annual work hours per student: 2,000
- Total student hours: 200,000
- Expected improvement: 1%

**Calculation:**
- Training Cost: (24 + 40) × $200 = $12,800
- Student time cost: 100 × 8 hours × $100 = $80,000
- Total Cost: $12,800 + $80,000 = $92,800
- Performance Gain: 200,000 × 1% = 2,000 hours
- Value of gain: 2,000 hours × $100 = $200,000
- ROI: ($200,000 - $92,800) / $92,800 = 116%

**Note:** While still positive, the ROI is much lower due to the massive student time cost. This illustrates why Task 2 (training everyone) requires careful justification.
