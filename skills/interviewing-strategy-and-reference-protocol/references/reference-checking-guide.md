# Detailed Reference Checking Guide

## Pre-Call Preparation
- Have candidate's resume and interview notes ready
- Prepare specific questions based on interview observations
- Allow at least 30 minutes per reference call

## Rapport Building Techniques

### With Strangers
1. Start with small talk to establish comfort
2. Look for common ground (schools, industries, geography)
3. Share brief context about the role to frame the conversation
4. Move to substantive questions only after establishing connection

### With Known References
1. Acknowledge the relationship directly
2. Use the existing trust to probe more deeply
3. Ask "off the record" questions that leverage the personal connection

## Timing Strategy
- First 10 minutes: Establish connection, set context
- Middle 10 minutes: Standard reference questions
- Last 10 minutes: Most valuable for candid insights after bond is formed

## Questions to Ask References
- Verify projects and achievements described by candidate
- Probe areas where candidate showed weakness
- Ask about problems the candidate encountered and how they solved them
- Assess candidate's readiness for the new role level
- Explore what the reference knows about the candidate's values
