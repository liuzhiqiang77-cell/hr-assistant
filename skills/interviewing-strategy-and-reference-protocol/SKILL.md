# Interviewing Strategy and Reference Protocol

## When to Use
- When planning an overall interviewing strategy for a role
- When checking references after completing initial interviews
- When conducting follow-up interviews with candidates
- When analyzing the limitations and risks of the hiring process

## Strategic Framework

### 1. Define the Ultimate Purpose
The core objective of interviewing is to:
- Judge the candidate's potential contribution in a new environment
- Project past performance into your organization's context
- Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit

### 2. Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks
Follow these principles throughout the interview process:
- Do not use tricks or gimmicks to test character (e.g., three-legged chair)
- Be completely straightforward with the candidate
- Show yourself and the environment as they really are
- **Rationale**: A candidate is a potential employee. Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired.

## Reference Checking Protocol

### Goal
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly, but from an external source.

### Build Rapport
- **If you know the reference personally**: You have a better chance of getting real information
- **If the reference is a stranger**: Keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

### Timing Principle
The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond.

## Follow-up Interviews
- If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks
- Clarify any discrepancies or concerns that emerged

## Acknowledge Limitations
Recognize the inherent constraints of the hiring process:
- Careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- The process merely increases the odds of hiring well
- Accept that failure is always a possibility

## Decision Output
The process yields a hiring decision based on:
- Comprehensive assessment of candidate potential
- Reference validation of candidate claims
- Risk acknowledgment and probability assessment
