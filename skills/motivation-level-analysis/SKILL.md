# Motivation Level Analysis

## When to Use
- Analyzing an employee's reaction to a raise or compensation change
- Identifying specific motivators for an individual
- Understanding why an employee behaves in a certain way
- Determining whether money serves as a utilitarian need or achievement measure

## Maslow's Need Level Classification

### Physiological Needs
- **Definition**: Basic necessities of life (food, clothing) that money can buy
- **Driver**: Fear of deprivation (e.g., starvation)
- **Example**: Working to avoid starvation

### Safety/Security Needs
- **Definition**: Desire to protect oneself from slipping back to deprivation
- **Driver**: Protection against catastrophic loss
- **Example**: Medical insurance protecting against bankruptcy
- **Note**: Rarely dominant, but absence badly affects performance

### Social/Affiliation Needs
- **Definition**: Inherent desire to belong to a group with common traits
- **Driver**: Companionship and team identity
- **Example**: Taking a low-paying job for colleague companionship

### Esteem/Recognition Needs
- **Definition**: Desire to keep up with or emulate a specific person or group
- **Driver**: Recognition from a specific reference group
- **Note**: Esteem exists in the eyes of the beholder; self-limiting once goal reached

### Self-Actualization
- **Definition**: Need to achieve one's "utter personal best"
- **Characteristic**: Does not extinguish after fulfillment; drives ever higher performance

## Money Motivation Hierarchy Test

### Step 1: Observe Reaction to Compensation Change
Assess how the employee reacts to a salary increase:

- **Scenario A**: Focuses on the ABSOLUTE SUM of money received
- **Scenario B**: Focuses on the RELATIVE COMPARISON against others

### Step 2: Determine Motivation Mode

**If Scenario A (Absolute Sum)**:
- Employee is motivated by Physiological or Safety needs
- Money is a utilitarian resource to buy necessities
- Motivation ceases once monetary target is met

**If Scenario B (Relative Comparison)**:
- Employee is motivated by Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization
- Money is a "measure of achievement"
- Motivation is boundless; each increment signifies achievement

### Step 3: Interpret Result
- **Lower Levels**: Money satisfies a deficit need
- **Upper Levels**: Money satisfies a growth need and serves as a success scorecard

## Key Considerations
- Interpretation of needs is subjective (esteem exists in the eyes of the beholder)
- Cultural differences may affect "expected level" for physiological/safety needs
- Self-actualization is the only need that doesn't extinguish
