# Managerial Training Program

## When to Use This Skill
- Manager needs to increase organizational output
- Subordinates lack specific skills or capability
- New employees join the organization
- New principles, ideas, or skills need to be introduced
- Designing or evaluating a training strategy

## Manager's Responsibility for Training

### Fundamental Principle
A manager's output is strictly defined as **'the output of his organization—no more, no less.'**

### Performance Levers
To increase individual performance, utilize two principal means:
1. **Increasing motivation** (desire to do the job well)
2. **Increasing individual capability** (via training)

**Key Insight**: Just as motivation cannot be fully delegated, neither should training be delegated solely to specialists.

### Who Should Train?
- **The manager** must instruct direct subordinates and the next few ranks below them
- **Rationale**: Training must be performed by a "suitable role model" who is a "believable, practicing authority"
- **Constraint**: Proxies, regardless of subject matter expertise, cannot fill this role effectively

## Calculate Training ROI

### Preparation Standard
Allocate **3 hours of preparation for every 1 hour of course time**.

### ROI Calculation Example
| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Preparation Time | 12 hours (4 lectures × 3 hours prep) |
| Number of Students | 10 |
| Annual Student Work Hours | 20,000 hours total |
| Performance Improvement Target | 1% |
| **Organizational Gain** | **200 hours** (1% of 20,000) |
| **Investment** | **12 hours** |
| **Net Gain** | **188 hours** |

**Result**: A 1% performance improvement yields 200 hours of gained work for a 12-hour investment.

## Ensure Cultural Alignment

### Risk
Mismatch between teaching and practice **demoralizes participants**.

### Guidelines
- **AVOID** 'highly structured and academic' approaches if they contradict company practices
- **Example**: If company tradition is a 'free market' where employees apply for jobs on their own initiative, do not teach 'carefully coordinated job rotations' or long-term career plans that look ahead several years
- Training content must align with company culture

## Maintain Consistency

### Process vs. Event
- Training must be a **'process, not an event'**
- Provide a **'reliable, consistent presence'** that is 'systematic and scheduled'
- **DO NOT** use training as a 'rescue effort summoned to solve the problem of the moment'

### Risk of Insufficient Training
Failure to train employees to recognize specific conditions leads to:
- Inefficiencies
- Excess costs
- Unhappy customers
- Danger

**Example**: An untrained operator operating an ion implanter caused >$1M in scrapped material and delivery slips.

## Determine Training Volume

### Establish Curriculum Scope
Maintain a catalogue of courses covering:
- Basic skills (e.g., telephone manners)
- Complex technical skills (e.g., ion implanter operation requiring ~200 hours)
- Management disciplines (e.g., strategic planning, "constructive confrontation", performance reviews, productive meetings)

**Benchmark**: Allocate approximately **2% to 4% of employee time** to classroom learning.

### Classify the Training Task
| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Task 1: New Member Training | Teaching new members the skills needed to perform their jobs |
| Task 2: New Skill Training | Teaching new ideas, principles, or skills to present members |

### Calculate Training Volume for Task 1 (New Members)
```
Annual Training Load (%) = Annual Turnover Rate (%) + Annual Growth Rate (%)
```

**Example**: A department with 10% turnover and 10% growth must train **20% of its staff annually**.

### Calculate Training Volume for Task 2 (New Skills)
```
Task 2 Magnitude = 100% / Task 1 Load
```

**Example**: If Task 1 load is 20%, Task 2 is **5 times larger** (100% / 20%).

### Evaluate Cost and Feasibility
- Calculate cost based on student time
- **Benchmark**: A one-day course for middle-management staff can cost over **$1,000,000** in student time alone
- **Decision Rule**: Do not enter into Task 2 (training all staff) lightly due to high magnitude and cost

## Key Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| prep_ratio | Numeric | Hours of preparation per hour of course time (standard: 3) |
| total_student_hours | Numeric | Total annual work hours of the trained group |
| performance_improvement | Percentage | Efficiency gain through training (e.g., 1%) |
| Annual Turnover Rate | Percentage | Staff leaving organization annually |
| Annual Growth Rate | Percentage | Organization growth annually |
| Task 1 Load | Percentage | Staff requiring basic training (Turnover + Growth) |
| Task 2 Magnitude | Multiplier | Factor by which training all staff exceeds training new staff |

## Output Template
Identification of:
- Required trainer (manager)
- Training task classification (New Member vs. New Skill)
- Calculated percentage of staff requiring training
- ROI estimate for the training investment
