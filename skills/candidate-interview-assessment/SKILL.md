# Candidate Interview Assessment

Conduct structured interviews to assess candidates across multiple dimensions of capability and fit.

## When to Use
- Conducting a scheduled interview session with a job candidate
- Evaluating candidate skills, values, and problem-solving capacity
- Assessing candidate readiness and potential fit for the role

## Core Interviewing Techniques

### 1. Ask Key Assessment Questions
Pose these specific questions to evaluate different aspects:
- **Projects and Recognition**: "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- **Weaknesses and Growth**: "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
- **Value Proposition**: "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- **Problem-Solving**: "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
- **Readiness**: "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"
- **Achievements**: "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

### 2. Categorize Inquiries for Coverage
Ensure comprehensive assessment by covering these categories:
- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, weaknesses, technical capabilities
- **Application of Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures, learning from experience
- **Discrepancies**: How they handle problems, prevention strategies, self-reflection
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new job, alignment with company needs

### 3. Use Direct Questions for Authentic Assessment
- Ask blunt, direct questions such as "How good are you technically?"
- Observe the candidate's immediate reaction
- Gauge confidence versus timidity in the response
- Assess actual capability through response quality, not just content

### 4. Employ Hypothetical Situations
- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps)
- Pose a concrete problem to solve (e.g., calculate finished cost of a wafer)
- Evaluate their ability to derive principles on the fly
- Assess problem-solving methodology and reasoning capacity

### 5. Analyze Candidate Questions
- Invite the candidate to ask questions about you, the company, or the job
- Analyze what their questions reveal about:
  - Their existing knowledge of the role/industry
  - What they value in a position or organization
  - Their level of preparation and research

## Output
Generate an assessment covering:
- Technical skills and capabilities
- Problem-solving approach and reasoning capacity
- Operational values and cultural fit
- Readiness for the specific role
- Overall potential contribution
