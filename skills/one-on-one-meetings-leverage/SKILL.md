# Strategic Leverage of One-on-One Meetings

One-on-one meetings are a high-leverage activity where a small time investment (1.5 hours) can enhance a subordinate's work quality for a significant duration (80+ hours) and upgrade the supervisor's understanding of tasks.

## When to Use
- Supervisor schedules a recurring meeting with a direct report
- Need to develop shared understanding of tasks and priorities
- Preparing to delegate complex work
- Analyzing business trends or indicators together
- Need to cascade strategic decisions across the organization

## Prerequisites
- Regular scheduled meeting time established (e.g., bi-weekly)
- Hierarchical reporting relationship exists
- Both parties willing to share information openly

## Execution Steps

### 1. Calculate Leverage Potential
Recognize that a small time investment (e.g., 1.5 hours) enhances work quality for the impact duration (e.g., two weeks of 80+ hours).

### 2. Establish Common Base
Develop a "common base of information" and "similar ways of doing and handling things" between supervisor and subordinate. This shared base is essential for efficient delegation.

### 3. Facilitate Reverse Teaching
Allow the subordinate to teach you specific details and data you may only be vaguely familiar with. This information is absolutely essential for making good decisions.

### 4. Joint Data Analysis
Review specific indicators together (e.g., trend indicators of incoming orders). Ponder the data and consider their relationship to other industry indicators to distinguish:
- Temporary anomalies (e.g., seasonal slowness)
- Actual business trends (e.g., business stopped growing)

### 5. Formulate Congruent Conclusions
Develop a congruent attitude, approach, and conclusion based on shared analysis. Example: Deciding on a "conservative approach to near-term investment" rather than assuming growth.

### 6. Execute Cascading Actions
- **Subordinate**: Implements decisions in their specific area of responsibility (e.g., scale back growth)
- **Supervisor**: Shares conclusions with other business groups or managers, multiplying the leverage of the single meeting

## Key Variables
- `meeting_duration`: Length of the session (e.g., 1.5 hours)
- `impact_duration`: Period of enhanced work quality (e.g., two weeks)
- `information_base`: Shared understanding and context
