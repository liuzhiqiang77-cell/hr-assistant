# Delegation and Task-Relevant Maturity

Effective delegation requires understanding your subordinate's capability for specific tasks, establishing shared values, and monitoring appropriately. This skill covers the complete delegation workflow from assessment to follow-through.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Before delegating a task** to assess if the subordinate is ready
- **When a subordinate struggles** with assigned work to diagnose the gap
- **When structuring your team's workload** to optimize leverage
- **When monitoring delegated work** to ensure quality without micromanaging
- **When onboarding new subordinates** to establish operational values

## Core Concepts

### Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

TRM is NOT general competence or age. It is the combination of:
- Achievement orientation and readiness for responsibility
- Education, training, and experience **specific to the task at hand**

**Key insight:** A person can have high TRM in one job but low TRM in another. Even seasoned managers have low TRM when facing new environments, content, or accelerated work pace. TRM can change day by day or hour by hour.

### Operational Values

Effective delegation requires a shared "information base"—common understanding of:
- How work gets done in the organization
- Priorities and preferences
- Standards and expectations

Without this commonality, delegation requires constant specific instructions and yields low leverage.

## Delegation Workflow

### Step 1: Assess TRM for the Specific Task

Evaluate the subordinate against the task requirements:

| Assessment Factor | Questions to Ask |
|------------------|------------------|
| Achievement Orientation | Are they driven to complete this specific task? |
| Readiness for Responsibility | Will they take ownership of the outcome? |
| Relevant Experience | What specific training/background do they have for THIS task? |
| Environmental Fit | Is the pace, content, or environment new to them? |

**Classify TRM Level:**
- **Low TRM:** New to task, new environment, or task has changed abruptly
- **Medium/Growing TRM:** Some experience with task, demonstrating responsibility
- **High TRM:** Extensive experience with task, proven track record

### Step 2: Establish Shared Operational Values (If Missing)

If TRM is low or you lack a common information base:

1. **Transmit values explicitly:** The supervisor must teach the correct way to do things
2. **Prevent "customer tuition":** Do not allow subordinates to learn through mistakes that impact customers. Supervisor must teach early.
3. **Internalize structure:** As TRM grows, structure moves from externally imposed to internally adopted
4. **Verify understanding:** Confirm the subordinate understands priorities, preferences, and organizational working style

**Critical principle:** You cannot effectively delegate without a shared set of values because you remain accountable for the output.

### Step 3: Select Tasks to Delegate

Apply these rules when choosing what to delegate:

1. **Prerequisite check:** Ensure you and the subordinate share a common information base. Without this, delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage.

2. **Familiarity rule:** When given a choice, delegate activities that are **familiar to you** rather than unfamiliar ones. It's easier to monitor tasks you know best.

3. **Avoid insincere delegation:** Do not emotionally hold onto tasks while pretending to delegate. If you keep a task because you enjoy it, make it a conscious decision rather than a charade.

### Step 4: Monitor Without Meddling

Apply quality assurance principles to track delegated work:

**Principle 1: Monitor at the lowest-added-value stage**
- Check rough drafts early, not final polished versions
- Catch basic content problems before expensive work is done
- Example: Review a report outline or first draft rather than waiting for the final version

**Principle 2: Sample, don't check 100%**
- Go into details randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress
- Do not review every detail like 100% QA testing

**Principle 3: Adjust frequency based on TRM**
- **Newly delegated tasks / Low TRM:** Monitor frequently
- **Proven performance / Higher TRM:** Decrease monitoring intensity over time
- **Task changes or environment shifts:** Increase frequency until TRM re-establishes

### Step 5: Retain Accountability

**Delegation without follow-through is abdication.**

You never wash your hands of the task. You remain responsible for its accomplishment, even as the subordinate does the work. Your role shifts from doing to ensuring.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence | Correct Approach |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Letting subordinates "pay tuition" via customer-impacting mistakes | Damaged relationships, lost business | Supervisor teaches correct values early | 
| Delegating unfamiliar tasks | Inability to monitor effectively | Delegate familiar tasks you can assess |
| Insincere delegation (holding on while pretending to let go) | Confusion, resentment, no leverage gained | Either delegate fully or keep ownership consciously |
| Meddling (prescribing specific activities) | Stifles growth, reduces leverage | Monitor outcomes and early drafts, not methods |
| Confusing general maturity with TRM | Misaligned expectations, poor delegation | Assess TRM specifically for each task |

## Decision Support

**Use delegation when:**
- Subordinate has adequate TRM for the specific task
- You have established shared operational values
- You can monitor effectively (task is familiar)
- You want to increase your managerial leverage

**Do not delegate when:**
- No common information base exists and cannot be quickly established
- Task is unfamiliar to you (cannot monitor quality)
- Consequences of error are extremely high and subordinate has low TRM
- You are emotionally unable to release control (insincere delegation risk)
