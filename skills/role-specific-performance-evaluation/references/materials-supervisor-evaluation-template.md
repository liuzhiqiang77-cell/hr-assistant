## Example Evaluation Comments

### Positive Example (Meets Requirements):
> "John effectively manages the production planning process with good site coordination. He has transitioned well from finance to manufacturing, leveraging his financial background to assist the Purchasing group with cost analysis. However, John needs improvement in goal setting for the manufacturing specifications system. His system reviews often conclude with general statements rather than specific objectives. Additionally, he tends to schedule meetings without defining clear outcomes beforehand. With focused coaching on these areas, John should be ready for promotion consideration next cycle."

### Negative Example (Not Eligible for Promotion):
> "Maria has struggled to define clear goals for the manufacturing specifications process. Her March review concluded with 'we need to improve the system' without specific targets or timelines. She frequently schedules meetings as a substitute for progress, believing that discussing issues constitutes advancement. While she has learned quickly from her finance background, she has not demonstrated the ability to independently drive complex projects to completion. Maria requires significant development in goal clarity and results-oriented project management before promotion can be considered."
