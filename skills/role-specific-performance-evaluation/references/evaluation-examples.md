## Promotion Decision Framework

### Required for Promotion

1. **Goal Setting**
   - Clear: Unambiguous, understandable
   - Concise: Brief, to the point
   - Specific: Measurable, time-bound
   - Example: "Reduce spec approval cycle from 5 days to 3 days by Q3"

2. **Meeting Effectiveness**
   - Pre-defined outcomes for each meeting
   - Results-oriented, not process-oriented
   - Example: "Approve 5 spec changes, reject 2, defer 1"

3. **Independence**
   - Primary driver on complex projects
   - Supervisor provides guidance, not direction
   - Proactive problem identification and resolution

4. **Background Utilization**
   - Voluntary assistance to other areas
   - Leverage prior expertise
   - Cross-functional contribution

### Transition Context Considerations

**Finance to Manufacturing**:
- Allow 6-12 months for domain knowledge building
- Evaluate learning speed and application
- Consider complexity of manufacturing environment
- Recognize cultural differences between functions

**Rating Adjustment**:
- First 6 months: Focus on learning speed and effort
- 6-12 months: Focus on application and independence
- 12+ months: Full performance expectations apply
