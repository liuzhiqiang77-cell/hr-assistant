# Role-Specific Performance Evaluation

## When to Use This Skill
- Evaluating managers in specialized or technical roles
- Creating role-specific evaluation criteria
- Assessing promotion eligibility for management positions
- Evaluating employees transitioning between functional areas

## General Evaluation Framework

### Step 1: Assess Core Responsibilities
Verify the employee's primary responsibilities and scope of authority.

### Step 2: Evaluate Performance in Key Areas

| Area | Evaluation Criteria |
|------|-------------------|
| Process Management | Significant process changes, coordination efficiency, administrative effectiveness |
| Goal Setting | Clear, concise, specific goals vs. "mushy" conclusions |
| Meeting Effectiveness | Distinguishing meetings from actual progress |
| Strength Utilization | Speed of learning, application of prior background |
| Project Independence | Ability to be primary driver on complex projects |

### Step 3: Determine Promotion Eligibility

**Required Capabilities**:
- Ability to take complex projects and show results
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of ways to achieve goals
- Independence (primary driver, supervisor helps only when needed)

### Step 4: Final Rating Determination

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| Exceeds Requirements | Consistently exceeds expectations in all areas |
| Meets Requirements | Capable of doing current job, some areas need improvement |
| Does Not Meet | Fails to meet core responsibilities |

### Step 5: Context Adjustment
Consider environmental factors such as:
- Transition difficulties between functional areas
- Organizational changes
- External constraints

## Example: Materials Support Supervisor Evaluation

### Core Responsibilities
- Managing the production planning process
- Managing the manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

### Production Planning Performance

**Positive Indicators**:
- Significant process changes during review period
- Sites well coordinated
- Administrative activities efficiently done

**Rating**: Good if above indicators present

### Manufacturing Specifications Performance

#### Goal Setting Assessment

**Negative Indicators**:
- Difficulty setting objectives and key results
- "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews
- Lack of definitive statement on system direction

**Consequence**: Falling into trap of "working on" things without reaching objectives

#### Meeting Effectiveness Assessment

**Negative Indicator**: Satisfaction that having a meeting on a subject constitutes progress

**Corrective Action**: Employee must define specific results to accomplish **prior** to each meeting

### Strengths & Background Utilization

**Evaluate**:
- Speed of learning (getting up to speed quickly)
- Utilization of prior background to assist other areas voluntarily

**Example**: Finance background helping Purchasing group sort out finance problems

### Promotion Eligibility

**Current Status**: Promotion denied if specific criteria not met

**Required Actions**:
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of the way to achieve those goals
- Independence: Must be primary driver on complex projects

### Final Rating

**Meets Requirements**: Assigned if capable of doing current job, but acknowledging specific areas (goal setting, defining ways of accomplishing tasks) need improvement

**Context Adjustment**: Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing)

## Creating Role-Specific Frameworks

### Step 1: Define Core Responsibilities
List the 3-5 primary responsibilities of the role.

### Step 2: Identify Success Metrics
For each responsibility, define:
- What success looks like
- What failure looks like
- Key behaviors to observe

### Step 3: Establish Evaluation Criteria
Create specific, observable criteria for each area of performance.

### Step 4: Define Promotion Requirements
Specify what capabilities must be demonstrated for the next level.

### Step 5: Document Context Factors
List environmental factors that should be considered in evaluation.

## Constraints
- Does not apply to non-exempt employees without modification
- Specific functional context is a key variable in evaluation
- Requires understanding of the role's technical domain
