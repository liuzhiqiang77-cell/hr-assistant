description: Analyze human motivation drivers using Maslow's hierarchy of needs to identify dominant unsatisfied needs and predict behavior. Use when diagnosing what motivates an individual, understanding why motivation changes over time, or determining which needs are currently driving performance.

# Maslow Hierarchy Motivation Analysis

## When to Use
- Analyzing human motivation drivers for individuals or teams
- Identifying specific motivators for an employee
- Understanding why motivation levels change
- Predicting behavior based on need satisfaction

## Core Principles

### The Motivation Chain
Needs cause drives, which result in motivation. Only unsatisfied needs motivate.

### Key Rules
1. **Satiation Rule**: A satisfied need stops being a source of motivation
2. **Maintenance Requirement**: Keep some needs unsatisfied to maintain high motivation
3. **Dominance Principle**: One need is always stronger and determines motivation/performance
4. **Hierarchical Progression**: When lower needs are satisfied, higher needs take over
5. **Regressive Movement**: Drastic environmental changes can cause instant regression to fundamental needs

## Need Levels

### Physiological Needs
- **Definition**: Basic necessities (food, clothing) that money can buy
- **Driver**: Fear of deprivation (e.g., starvation)
- **Example**: Working to avoid starvation

### Safety/Security Needs
- **Definition**: Protection from slipping back to deprivation
- **Driver**: Protection against catastrophic loss
- **Example**: Medical insurance to prevent bankruptcy from hospital fees
- **Note**: Rarely dominant but absence badly affects performance

### Social/Affiliation Needs
- **Definition**: Desire to belong to a group with common traits
- **Driver**: Companionship and team identity
- **Example**: Taking a low-paying job for colleague companionship

### Esteem/Recognition Needs
- **Definition**: Desire to keep up with or emulate a specific person or group
- **Driver**: Recognition from a specific reference group
- **Note**: Esteem exists in the eyes of the beholder; self-limiting once goal is reached

### Self-Actualization
- **Definition**: Need to achieve one's "utter personal best"
- **Driver**: Testing limits of capability
- **Note**: Does not extinguish after fulfillment; drives ever higher performance

## Analysis Procedure

1. **Observe Behavior**: Identify what the individual is seeking or avoiding
2. **Map to Need Level**: Classify the behavior into one of the five need levels
3. **Identify Dominant Need**: Determine which unsatisfied need is strongest
4. **Assess Context**: Consider environmental factors that might cause regression
5. **Predict Motivation**: Based on the dominant unsatisfied need, predict what will motivate the individual

## Key Insight
People have concurrent needs, but the dominant unsatisfied need largely determines motivation and performance level.
