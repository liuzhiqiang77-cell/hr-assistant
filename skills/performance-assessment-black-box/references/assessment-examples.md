## Trade-off Documentation Example

"Assessment weights: 60% Output, 40% Internal. Rationale: Organization is in growth phase requiring both current performance and capability building. Employee exceeded output targets (120%) but showed limited internal contribution (mentoring, process improvement). Final rating reflects strong current performance with note to increase internal focus next quarter."
