# Performance Assessment - Black Box Methodology

## When to Use
- Conducting performance reviews
- Evaluating employee contributions for compensation decisions
- Making promotion or retention decisions
- Assessing both current results and future potential

## Core Concept
The employee is a "black box" where you assess both the output (what comes out) and internal activities (what happens inside).

## Procedure

### Step 1: Define Expectations
Before assessment begins:
- Clarify what is expected from the subordinate
- Establish clear standards for evaluation
- Ensure subordinate understands criteria

### Step 2: Evaluate Output Measures
Assess tangible, measurable results:
- Completed designs, projects, deliverables
- Sales quotas met or exceeded
- Production yield improvements
- Any result that can be plotted on a chart

### Step 3: Evaluate Internal Measures
Assess activities that contribute to performance:

**Current Period Contributions**:
- Activities creating output for the current period
- Day-to-day work quality and effort

**Future-Focused Activities**:
- Positioning and developing people
- Ensuring department health
- Preventing future problems
- Building capabilities for future output

### Step 4: Determine Weighting
There is no strict formula—weighting is situational:

**Examples**:
- **50/50**: Balanced focus on current results and future building
- **90/10**: Crisis mode—focus almost entirely on immediate output
- **10/90**: Development phase—focus on building future capability

Weighting can shift monthly based on organizational needs.

### Step 5: Trade-off Analysis
Explicitly identify what you're trading off:
- Current output vs future capability
- Short-term results vs long-term health
- Individual achievement vs team development

## Output
A balanced performance assessment with explicit weighting of output and internal measures.
