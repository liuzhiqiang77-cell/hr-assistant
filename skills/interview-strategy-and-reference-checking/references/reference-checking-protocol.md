# Reference Checking Protocol

## Pre-Call Preparation
- Review the information gathered from the candidate
- Identify specific areas you want to verify or explore
- Note any discrepancies or concerns from the interview

## Call Structure

### First 10 Minutes
- Introduce yourself and explain the purpose of the call
- Build rapport through casual conversation
- Look for common connections or experiences
- Establish a comfortable tone

### Middle 10 Minutes
- Begin asking about the candidate's work history
- Discuss specific projects or achievements mentioned by the candidate
- Seek examples of the candidate's performance in different situations

### Final 10 Minutes (Most Valuable)
- Ask more direct and probing questions
- Seek honest assessment of strengths and weaknesses
- Inquire about reasons for leaving and whether they would rehire
- Ask for overall recommendation and any concerns

## Key Questions to Ask References
- "How long did you work with the candidate?"
- "What were their primary responsibilities?"
- "Can you describe a significant project they worked on?"
- "What are their greatest strengths?"
- "What areas need improvement?"
- "How did they handle challenges or conflicts?"
- "Would you hire them again? Why or why not?"

## Red Flags
- Hesitation or reluctance to provide specific examples
- Vague or overly general praise
- Refusal to comment on certain areas
- Inconsistent information compared to candidate's statements
