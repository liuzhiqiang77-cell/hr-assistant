# Interview Strategy and Reference Checking

Use these strategic principles when planning interviews, checking references, or analyzing interview results.

## Prerequisites
- Completed initial interview
- List of references

## Define the Ultimate Purpose

Judge potential contribution in a new environment by:
- Projecting past performance into the new environment
- Moving between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit

## Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks

Do NOT use "tricks" to test character (e.g., three-legged chair tests).
- Be completely straightforward
- Show yourself and the environment as they really are

**Rationale**: A candidate is a potential employee. Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired.

## Execute Reference Checking

**Goal**: Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.

### Build Rapport

- If you know the reference personally: Leverage this relationship for better chances of getting "real" information
- If the reference is a stranger: Keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

### Timing Matters

The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond.

## Conduct Follow-up Interviews

If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references. Use this time to:
- Address new perspectives gained from the reference checks
- Clarify any discrepancies discovered

## Acknowledge Limitations

- Recognize that careful interviewing does NOT guarantee success
- Accept that it merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well
- High risk of failure is inherent in the process
