# Life or Death Test Examples

## Example 1: Sales Representative Not Meeting Quota

**Scenario**: A sales rep consistently misses quarterly targets.

**Test Question**: "If their life depended on closing deals, could they do it?"

**Analysis**:
- If YES: They know how to sell but lack motivation. Use motivational strategies (incentives, career path discussions, coaching on drive).
- If NO: They lack sales skills. Use training (product knowledge, sales techniques, objection handling).

## Example 2: Engineer Missing Deadlines

**Scenario**: A software engineer consistently delivers code late.

**Test Question**: "If their life depended on delivering on time, could they do it?"

**Analysis**:
- If YES: They can code fast enough but choose not to. Address motivation (workload, engagement, incentives).
- If NO: They lack technical efficiency or time management skills. Provide training (coding practices, estimation techniques, tools).

## Example 3: Customer Service Representative

**Scenario**: CSR receives poor customer satisfaction scores.

**Test Question**: "If their life depended on satisfying customers, could they do it?"

**Analysis**:
- If YES: They have the skills but don't care. Address motivation (recognition, career growth, purpose).
- If NO: They lack communication or problem-solving skills. Provide training (de-escalation, product knowledge, empathy).
