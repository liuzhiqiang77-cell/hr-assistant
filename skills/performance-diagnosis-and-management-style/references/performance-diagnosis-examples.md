# Performance Diagnosis Examples

## Example 1: Capability Issue (Can't Do It)

**Situation**: A sales representative consistently fails to close deals despite working long hours.

**Life or Death Test**: "If their life depended on closing this deal, could they do it?"

**Answer**: NO - They lack the negotiation skills and product knowledge required.

**Diagnosis**: Capability issue

**Intervention**: Provide comprehensive sales training, product knowledge workshops, and mentorship.

## Example 2: Motivation Issue (Won't Do It)

**Situation**: A software developer writes excellent code but consistently misses deadlines and submits work late.

**Life or Death Test**: "If their life depended on submitting on time, could they do it?"

**Answer**: YES - They have the technical skills and time management capability.

**Diagnosis**: Motivation issue

**Intervention**: Discuss career goals, connect work to personal interests, provide recognition for timely delivery, or address underlying disengagement.

## Task-Relevant Maturity Examples

### Example 1: Same Person, Different Tasks

**Employee**: Senior Engineer with 10 years experience

**Task A**: Debugging complex system issue
- **Maturity**: High (mature)
- **Style**: Delegate approach
- **Action**: "I know you can handle this. Let me know if you need anything."

**Task B**: Giving a presentation to executives
- **Maturity**: Low (immature - never done this before)
- **Style**: Hands-on training
- **Action**: Review slides together, practice delivery, attend the meeting as support

### Example 2: The "Learn by Mistakes" Trap

**Wrong Approach**:
- Manager: "Go ahead and manage the project. You'll learn from your mistakes."
- Result: Project fails, customer is unhappy, team loses confidence

**Correct Approach**:
- Manager: "This is your first project management role. I'll work closely with you for the first month. We'll review your plans together, I'll attend your key meetings, and we'll debrief after each milestone."
- Result: Employee learns correctly, customer is satisfied, skills are built properly
