# Performance Diagnosis Examples

## Example 1: Sales Representative Not Meeting Quota

**Situation:** A sales rep consistently misses monthly targets.

**Life or Death Test:** "If their life depended on closing deals, could they do it?"
- **Assessment:** YES - they have closed deals before and understand the sales process
- **Diagnosis:** "Won't do it" - Motivation issue
- **Task Maturity:** Mature in sales skills
- **Intervention:** Motivation strategies (incentives, recognition, career path discussion)

## Example 2: New Engineer Struggling with Code Review

**Situation:** A junior engineer cannot effectively conduct code reviews.

**Life or Death Test:** "If their life depended on doing a thorough code review, could they do it?"
- **Assessment:** NO - they lack the experience and pattern recognition skills
- **Diagnosis:** "Can't do it" - Capability issue
- **Task Maturity:** Immature in code review specifically
- **Intervention:** Hands-on training with senior engineer pairing, not independent practice

## Example 3: Experienced Manager Failing to Delegate

**Situation:** A senior manager continues to do work that should be delegated to team.

**Life or Death Test:** "If their life depended on delegating effectively, could they do it?"
- **Assessment:** YES - they have the knowledge and skills
- **Diagnosis:** "Won't do it" - Motivation/behavioral issue
- **Task Maturity:** Mature in management skills
- **Intervention:** Coaching on trust-building, discussing the cost of not delegating

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Confusing General Capability with Task-Specific Maturity
A senior engineer may be mature in system architecture but immature in people management. Do not assume maturity transfers across domains.

### Pitfall 2: Misdiagnosing "Won't" as "Can't"
Sometimes employees claim inability to avoid accountability. Verify through testing or observation.

### Pitfall 3: Allowing "Learning by Mistakes" for Critical Tasks
For customer-facing, safety-critical, or expensive tasks, hands-on training is mandatory regardless of employee maturity level.
