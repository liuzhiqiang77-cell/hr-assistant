# Context: Distinguishing Top Managers

This decision-making process helps distinguish the top 5% of managers who think deeply about their craft from the 95% who do not.

## Common Interview Question

**Question:** "Is it better to be a hands-on or hands-off manager?"

**Correct Answer:** Neither is inherently better. The choice depends on the employee's task-relevant maturity. A top manager adjusts their style based on the specific task and the individual's capability for that task.
