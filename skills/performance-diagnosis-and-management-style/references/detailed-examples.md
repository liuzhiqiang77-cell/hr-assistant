# Detailed Examples and Context

## The Sports Analogy
The "Can't vs. Won't" framework is derived from sports psychology:
- A player who "can't" perform needs coaching and skill development
- A player who "won't" perform needs motivation and discipline

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Allowing "Learn by Mistakes" for Immature Employees
**Example**: A new sales representative is allowed to "learn by making mistakes" with clients.
**Consequence**: The company loses valuable clients and reputation while the subordinate learns.
**Correct Approach**: Provide hands-on training, role-playing, and supervised practice before client interactions.

### Pitfall 2: Misidentifying Task-Relevant Maturity
**Example**: A senior engineer is new to project management. The manager assumes maturity based on engineering experience.
**Consequence**: The engineer struggles with people management and project coordination.
**Correct Approach**: Assess maturity specifically for project management tasks, not engineering expertise.

## Interview Question
**"Is it better to be a hands-on or hands-off manager?"**

**Correct Answer**: "It depends on the employee's task-relevant maturity. For tasks where the employee is immature, hands-on training is essential. For tasks where they are mature, delegation is appropriate. The key is assessing maturity task-by-task, not person-by-person."
