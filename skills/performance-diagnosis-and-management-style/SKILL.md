# Performance Diagnosis and Management Style

When an employee is not performing or you need to decide how to manage a task, follow this two-part diagnostic approach.

## Part 1: Diagnose Performance Failure (Can't vs. Won't)

Use this diagnostic when observing poor performance or failure to do the job.

### The Diagnostic Process

1. **Identify the performance issue**: The person is not doing their job.

2. **Apply the 'Life or Death' Mental Test**: Ask yourself: "If the person's life depended on doing the work, could he do it?"

3. **Evaluate the answer to determine root cause**:
   - **YES** = The person is capable but NOT motivated → They "won't do it" (Motivation issue)
   - **NO** = The person is NOT capable → They "can't do it" (Capability issue)

4. **Select the managerial intervention**:
   - **Can't do it** (Capability): Use Training
   - **Won't do it** (Motivation): Use Motivation strategies

### Key Principle

These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job. Everything else is useless unless individuals try to offer their best.

## Part 2: Task-Relevant Maturity Management

Use this when deciding between hands-on or hands-off management for a specific task.

### Assessment Process

1. **Assess the employee's maturity level** specifically for the task at hand (Task-Relevant Maturity).

2. **Determine the appropriate management style**:

   - **IF employee is IMMATURE in the task**:
     - **Action**: Apply **hands-on training**
     - **Critical Constraint**: Do NOT allow the employee to "make their own mistakes" to learn
     - **Reasoning**: The subordinate's "tuition" would be paid by customers, which is absolutely wrong
   
   - **IF employee is MORE MATURE in the task**:
     - **Action**: Apply a **delegate approach** (hands-off management)

### Management Insight

This decision-making process distinguishes the top 5% of managers who think deeply about their craft from the 95% who do not.

## When to Use This Skill

- Addressing poor performance or failure to complete work
- Determining whether a performance issue requires training or motivational intervention
- Deciding how closely to supervise an employee on a specific task
- Onboarding new employees or assigning new responsibilities
- Responding to the interview question: "Is it better to be a hands-on or hands-off manager?"

## Constraints

- Do not apply the diagnostic if the root cause is external to the individual (e.g., equipment failure)
- Do not use "learn by mistakes" approach for immature employees
