# Performance Assessment Methodology

Use this skill to conduct balanced performance evaluations using the Black Box model.

## When to Use
- Conducting performance reviews for subordinates
- Assessing employee contributions over a period
- Needing to weigh current results against future capability building
- Evaluating both tangible and intangible contributions
- Making promotion, compensation, or development decisions

## The Black Box Model

The employee is viewed as a "black box" with two types of measures:
- **Output Measures**: What comes out of the box (tangible results)
- **Internal Measures**: What happens inside the box (activities and processes)

## Assessment Workflow

### Step 1: Define Expectations
- Clarify in advance what is expected from the subordinate
- Ensure assessment is against clear, pre-defined standards
- Document expectations before observation period begins

### Step 2: Evaluate Output Measures (Output of the Black Box)

**Assess Tangible Results**:
- Items that can be plotted on charts
- Concrete deliverables and achievements
- Examples:
  - Completing designs
  - Meeting sales quotas
  - Increasing production yield
  - Delivering projects on time/budget

### Step 3: Evaluate Internal Measures (Inside the Black Box)

**Assess Activities Creating Current Output**:
- Effort and processes that produced current results
- Work habits and methodologies
- Collaboration and communication

**Assess Activities Setting Stage for Future Output**:
- Positioning and developing people
- Ensuring department health
- Preventing future disgruntlement
- Building capabilities for future periods
- Knowledge sharing and documentation

### Step 4: Determine Weighting

**No Strict Formula**:
- There is no universal formula for comparing significance
- Weighting is situational and can shift over time

**Common Weighting Examples**:
- 50/50: Balanced emphasis on output and internal contributions
- 90/10: Output-focused (e.g., sales roles)
- 10/90: Development-focused (e.g., new hires, strategic roles)
- Can shift monthly based on priorities

### Step 5: Trade-off Analysis
- Explicitly identify which variables are being traded off
- Document rationale for weighting decisions
- Ensure trade-offs align with organizational goals
- Communicate trade-offs clearly to subordinate

## Constraints
- Difficult to apply strictly objectively to professional work
- Requires judgment and contextual understanding
- Weighting decisions should be documented and defensible
- Expectations must be defined in advance for fair assessment
