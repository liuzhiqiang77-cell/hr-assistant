## Weighting Justification Examples

### Scenario 1: Turnaround Situation
"Weighting is 70% Output / 30% Internal because the department is in crisis mode and immediate results are critical. Once stability is achieved, we will shift to 50/50 to focus on rebuilding."

### Scenario 2: New Manager Development
"Weighting is 40% Output / 60% Internal because this is a first-time manager who needs to build team management skills. Short-term output is secondary to developing long-term leadership capability."

### Scenario 3: Senior Strategic Role
"Weighting is 20% Output / 80% Internal because this role focuses on organizational strategy, relationship building, and capability development. Results will manifest over 2-3 years, not quarterly."
