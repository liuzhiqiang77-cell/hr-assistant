# Black Box Weighting Examples

## Scenario 1: Sales Role (Output-Heavy)
- Output Measures: 90%
- Internal Measures: 10%
- Rationale: Sales performance is primarily measured by quotas met and revenue generated

## Scenario 2: Research Scientist (Future-Oriented)
- Output Measures: 30%
- Internal Measures: 70%
- Rationale: Research has long time horizons; building knowledge and experimental design are critical

## Scenario 3: Engineering Manager (Balanced)
- Output Measures: 50%
- Internal Measures: 50%
- Rationale: Must deliver projects while developing team and ensuring technical excellence

## Scenario 4: Startup Founder (Extreme Future)
- Output Measures: 10%
- Internal Measures: 90%
- Rationale: Early-stage work is about building foundation; current revenue is minimal

## Time Offset Examples

### 'Light from Distant Stars'
- A new product launch succeeds due to R&D work from 3 years ago
- Current manager inherits high-performing team built by predecessor
- Sales spike results from marketing campaign initiated in prior fiscal year

### Building Future Capacity
- Setting up new manufacturing facility (no output yet, but critical activities)
- Implementing new quality system (current disruption, future benefit)
- Recruiting and training team (cost now, productivity later)

### Present Value Calculation Framework
1. Estimate total future benefit of activity
2. Apply discount rate based on risk and time horizon
3. Compare present value to alternative uses of time
4. Document rationale for weighting decision
