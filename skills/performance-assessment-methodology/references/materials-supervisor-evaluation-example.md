# Materials Support Supervisor Performance Evaluation Example

## Context
This is a specific evaluation framework for a Materials Support Supervisor transitioning from finance to manufacturing.

## Core Responsibilities
- Managing the production planning process
- Managing the manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

## Production Planning Performance Assessment

### Positive Indicators
- Significant process changes during the review period
- Sites are well coordinated
- Administrative activities are efficiently done

### Rating
"Good" if sites are well coordinated and activities are efficiently done.

## Manufacturing Specifications Performance Assessment

### Goal Setting Assessment
**Negative Indicators**:
- Difficulty setting objectives and key results
- "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews (e.g., March review)
- Lack of definitive statement on system direction

**Consequence**: Falling into the trap of "working on" things without reaching objectives.

### Meeting Effectiveness Assessment
**Negative Indicator**: Satisfaction that having a meeting on a subject constitutes progress.

**Corrective Action**: Employee must define specific results to accomplish *prior* to each meeting.

## Strengths & Background Utilization

### Evaluation Criteria
- Speed of learning (e.g., getting up to speed quickly to take over from predecessor effectively)
- Utilization of prior background (e.g., finance) to assist other areas voluntarily (e.g., helping Purchasing group sort out finance problems)

## Promotion Eligibility

### Current Status
Promotion to next management level is denied if specific criteria are not met, regardless of desire.

### Required Capabilities
Must be able to take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system) and show results.

### Required Actions
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of the way to achieve those goals

### Independence Requirement

### Context Adjustment
Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance.
