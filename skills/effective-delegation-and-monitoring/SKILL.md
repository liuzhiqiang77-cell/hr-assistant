# Effective Delegation and Monitoring

## When to Use This Skill
- Preparing to delegate tasks to subordinates
- Establishing delegation relationships with new team members
- Reviewing work from delegated tasks
- Adjusting supervision based on subordinate performance
- Preventing mistakes that impact customers

## Establish Shared Operational Values

Before effective delegation can occur:

1. **Ensure Commonality**
   - Share operational values, priorities, and preferences
   - Define "the correct way to do things" within the organization

2. **Teach Values Proactively**
   - Supervisor responsibility rests squarely with the manager
   - Structure moves from externally imposed to internally adopted as maturity grows

3. **Prevent Customer Tuition**
   - Do not allow subordinates to learn through customer-impacting mistakes
   - Teach correct operational values early

4. **Understand Accountability**
   - Supervisor remains accountable for subordinate output
   - Cannot effectively delegate without shared values

## Delegate Tasks Effectively

1. **Prerequisite Check**
   - Ensure delegator and delegatee share a common information base
   - Without shared context, delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage

2. **Avoid Insincere Delegation**
   - Do not emotionally hold onto tasks while pretending to delegate
   - If keeping a task because you enjoy it, make it a conscious decision

3. **Select Tasks Strategically**
   - When given a choice, delegate activities familiar to you
   - Easier to monitor tasks you know best

4. **Remember the Responsibility Principle**
   - "Delegation without follow-through is abdication"
   - You never wash your hands of the task
   - Remain responsible for accomplishment

## Monitor Delegated Tasks

1. **Quality Assurance Principle 1: Timing**
   - Monitor at the **lowest-added-value stage** of the process
   - Review rough drafts, not final polished versions
   - Catch basic content problems early before expensive work

2. **Quality Assurance Principle 2: Sampling**
   - Do not check 100% of details
   - Go into details randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress

3. **Adjust Frequency Based on Task-Relevant Maturity**
   - TRM = subordinate's experience with the specific task and prior performance
   - Newly delegated tasks: Increase monitoring frequency
   - As work improves over time: Decrease monitoring intensity

4. **Distinguish Monitoring from Meddling**
   - Monitoring: Ensuring activity proceeds in line with expectations
   - Meddling: Prescribing specific activities
   - Focus on results, not methods
