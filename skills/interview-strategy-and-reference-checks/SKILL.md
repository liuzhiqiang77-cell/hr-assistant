# Interview Strategy and Reference Checks

## When to Use
- When planning overall interview strategy
- When conducting reference checks after initial interviews
- When performing post-interview analysis and decision-making
- When preparing for follow-up interviews with candidates

## Strategic Framework

### 1. Define the Ultimate Purpose

The core objective is to:
- Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance
- Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit

### 2. Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks

**Principles:**
- Do not use "tricks" (e.g., three-legged chair) to test character
- Be completely straightforward
- Show yourself and the environment as they really are

**Rationale:**
- A candidate is a potential employee
- Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired

### 3. Execute Reference Checking

**Goal:**
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.

**Rapport Building:**
- If you know the reference personally, you have a better chance of getting "real" information
- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

**Timing Strategy:**
- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond

### 4. Conduct Follow-up Interviews

- If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks

### 5. Acknowledge Limitations

- Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- Accept that it merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well

## Output
Hiring decision based on comprehensive assessment and risk acknowledgment.
