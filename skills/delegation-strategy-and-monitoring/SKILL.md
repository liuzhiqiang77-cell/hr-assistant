# Delegation Strategy and Monitoring

Effective delegation requires a foundation of shared values, careful task selection, and appropriate monitoring. This skill guides you through the complete delegation lifecycle.

## Establish Operational Values Foundation

Before delegating, ensure you and your subordinate share common operational values:

1. **Establish Commonality**: Create a shared understanding of priorities, preferences, and how the organization works together
2. **Internalize Structure**: Help the subordinate adopt organizational structure internally rather than relying on external imposition
3. **Teach Correct Values**: As supervisor, you are responsible for transmitting correct operational values
4. **Prevent Customer Tuition**: Do not allow subordinates to learn through customer-impacting mistakes—teach them correctly from the start
5. **Ensure Accountability**: Remember that you remain accountable for your subordinate's output

## Select Tasks for Delegation

1. **Check Information Base**: Ensure you and the subordinate share a common information base and operational ideas
2. **Avoid Insincere Delegation**: Don't pretend to delegate tasks you emotionally hold onto; if you keep a task because you enjoy it, make it a conscious choice
3. **Delegate Familiar Tasks**: When given a choice, delegate activities you are familiar with rather than unfamiliar ones—they are easier to monitor
4. **Retain Responsibility**: "Delegation without follow-through is abdication"—you never wash your hands of the task

## Monitor Delegated Tasks

Apply quality assurance monitoring principles:

1. **Monitor at Lowest-Added-Value Stage**: Review rough drafts or early versions rather than waiting for polished work to catch basic problems early
2. **Sample Rather Than Check 100%**: Go into details randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress
3. **Adjust Frequency Based on TRM**: 
   - Increase monitoring for newly delegated tasks
   - Decrease intensity as the subordinate's performance improves over time
   - Base adjustments on task-relevant maturity (specific experience with this task), not general competence

## When to Use This Skill

- When you need to free up time by assigning work to others
- When onboarding new subordinates who need to learn operational values
- When assessing whether you are delegating effectively or abdicating responsibility
- When determining how closely to supervise a subordinate on a specific task
