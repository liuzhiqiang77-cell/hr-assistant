# Performance Indicators and Forecasting

## Daily Operational Review

Review these indicators each day to maintain operational control:

### 1. Sales Forecast
- Determine planned deliveries for today
- Compare yesterday's actual vs. planned deliveries to assess forecast confidence

### 2. Raw Material Inventory
- Verify stock levels of essential items
- **IF too low:** Order more supplies immediately
- **IF too high:** Cancel scheduled deliveries

### 3. Equipment Condition
- Check for breakdowns from yesterday
- **IF breakdown occurred:** Arrange repairs or rearrange production line

### 4. Manpower Assessment
- Check staff availability (sick leave, etc.)
- **IF understaffed:** Call temporary help OR reallocate from other lines

### 5. Quality Indicator
- Review customer complaint log
- **IF high complaints:** Address with responsible staff immediately

## Design Effective Indicators

### Key Principles:

1. **Attention Principle:** Indicators direct attention like steering a bicycle
2. **Guard Against Overreaction:** Focusing on a single metric leads to extreme behaviors
3. **Implement Paired Indicators:** Measure both 'effect' and 'counter-effect'

### Paired Indicator Examples:

| Primary Metric | Counter Metric |
|----------------|----------------|
| Inventory Levels | Incidence of Shortages |
| Completion Date | Capability |
| # Vouchers processed | # Errors found |
| # Square feet cleaned | Quality rating by manager |

### Administrative Indicator Rules:

1. Any measurement is better than none
2. Measure **Output** (results), not **Activity** (effort)
3. Measure **Physical/Countable** things: vouchers processed, transactions processed, people hired

## Linearity Indicator Analysis

Monitor progress toward deadlines to ensure even distribution of effort.

### Steps:

1. Plot actual output against time elapsed
2. Define 'Ideal Straight Line' from start to target
3. Compare actual progress vs. ideal line

### Interpretation:

| Scenario | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Below ideal line | Behind schedule | Accelerate performance |
| Above ideal line | Ahead of schedule | Potentially reallocate resources |
| Back-loaded (end of month) | Inefficient resource use | Address allocation issues |

### Purpose:
Provides 'early warning' to allow corrective action before deadline.

## Stagger Chart Forecasting

Track forecast evolution to identify changing business trends.

### Structure:
- **Rows:** Month the forecast was made
- **Columns:** Future months being forecasted

### Process:

1. **Initial Forecast:** Fill in forecasted values for future months
2. **Update Monthly:** Create new row each month with updated forecasts
3. **Analyze Variations:** Compare forecast for same target month across different forecast dates

### Interpretation:
- Significant variation indicates changing business trends
- Forces forecaster accountability by tracking prediction accuracy

## When to Use

- Starting daily operations management
- Designing performance measurement systems
- Tracking monthly or quarterly goals
- Forecasting future business trends
- Identifying performance issues before they become critical
