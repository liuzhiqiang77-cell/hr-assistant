# Interview Strategy and Reference Checking

## When to Use
- Planning overall interview strategy before engaging candidates
- Conducting reference checks after initial interviews
- Performing post-interview analysis and decision-making
- Assessing hiring risks and success probabilities

## Define the Ultimate Purpose

Keep the core objective clear throughout the process:

- Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance
- Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit
- Focus on past behavior as the best predictor of future performance

## Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks

**Critical Principle**: Do not use psychological tricks or manipulative tactics.

- Avoid "trick tests" (e.g., three-legged chair) to assess character
- Be completely straightforward in all interactions
- Show yourself and the work environment as they really are
- **Rationale**: A candidate is a potential employee. Wrong first impressions take significant time and effort to change if hired.

## Execute Reference Checking

**Goal**: Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly, but from external sources.

### Rapport Building Techniques

**If you know the reference personally:**
- Leverage existing relationship to get "real" information
- Reference is more likely to provide candid feedback

**If the reference is a stranger:**
- Keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association
- Build rapport to increase openness and honesty

### Timing Strategy

- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes
- Allocate sufficient time for rapport to develop
- Don't rush to conclusions early in the call
- Save probing questions for after rapport is established

## Conduct Follow-up Interviews

- If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from reference checks
- Clarify any discrepancies or concerns raised by references
- Give candidate opportunity to provide context for reference feedback

## Acknowledge Limitations

**Essential Reality Check**:

- Recognize that careful interviewing does NOT guarantee success
- Accept that thorough process merely increases the odds of hiring well
- High risk of failure remains inherent in hiring decisions
- No interview method can eliminate uncertainty completely

## Decision Framework

When making hiring decisions, consider:
- Projected past performance into new environment
- Consistency between candidate claims and reference feedback
- Overall risk tolerance and organizational needs
- Acknowledgment that some degree of luck is involved

## Output

Hiring decision based on:
- Comprehensive assessment across multiple data points
- Validation through reference checks
- Strategic alignment with organizational needs
- Clear acknowledgment of inherent risks and limitations
