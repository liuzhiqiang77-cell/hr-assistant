# Performance Review Delivery

## When to Use This Skill
- Conducting scheduled performance reviews for subordinates
- Addressing major performance problems that risk termination
- Determining when and how to deliver written reviews
- Handling self-reviews and upward feedback appropriately

## Fundamental Purpose of Performance Reviews

### Primary Goal
**Improve the subordinate's performance**—this is more important than rewards, discipline, feedback, raises, or other secondary purposes.

### Focus Areas
1. **Skill Level**: Identify missing skills and find ways to remedy them
2. **Motivation**: Intensify motivation to move the subordinate to a higher performance curve

**Secondary purposes** (acknowledge but prioritize below improvement):
- Assessing work, motivating, providing feedback
- Justifying raises, rewarding, discipline
- Providing direction, reinforcing culture

## Review Integrity and Delivery Protocols

### Handling Self-Reviews
- **DO NOT ask for a self-review** if you intend to simply reformat it and return it
- If you rely on the subordinate to tell you their accomplishments, you appear unaware and they feel cheated
- **Preserve integrity**: Make an upfront assessment of performance without being prompted by the subordinate

### Handling Upward Feedback
- You may ask the subordinate to evaluate your performance
- **Clearly state**: Their assessment has only **'advisory status'**
- **Never pretend** you and subordinates are equals—you are the leader

### Written Review Delivery Timing
| Timing Option | Risk |
|--------------|------|
| During Discussion (Not Recommended) | Subordinate reads ahead instead of listening; cannot stop to discuss; no time to process reactions |
| After Discussion (Not Recommended) | Subordinate may find phrases they didn't hear and react negatively/blow up |
| **Recommended Approach** | Ensure subordinate has time to work out reactions BEFORE discussion for a 'good meeting of minds' |

### Enforcing Quality
If a review is superficial, lacks analysis, or lacks depth—**insist on a rewrite**. The integrity of the performance review system is more important than the subordinate's preference.

## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process

### When to Use
- Subordinate has a major performance problem
- Turnaround is required to avoid firing
- Subordinate is in resistance or denial

### Step 1: Identify Current Stage in Resistance Cycle
| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1: Ignore | Passive ignoring of the problem |
| 2: Deny | Active denial of the problem's existence |
| 3: Blame Others | Admits problem exists but blames others |
| 4: Assume Responsibility | Admits 'It is my problem' |
| 5: Find Solution | Intellectual step to remedy the situation |

### Step 2: Facilitate Progression Through Stages
1. **Ignore → Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
2. **Deny → Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance
3. **Blame Others → Assume Responsibility**: This is the **emotional step** where the subordinate realizes "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
4. **Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**: This is the **intellectual step** and is relatively easier

### Step 3: Evaluate Possible Outcomes
- **Outcome 1**: Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
- **Outcome 2**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
- **Outcome 3**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Step 4: Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')
Use position power explicitly:

1. Assume formal supervisor role: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
2. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
3. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
4. Secure commitment to the course of action
5. Monitor performance against that commitment

## Key Insight
**'Assuming Responsibility' is an emotional step (hard), while 'Finding Solution' is an intellectual step (easier).**
