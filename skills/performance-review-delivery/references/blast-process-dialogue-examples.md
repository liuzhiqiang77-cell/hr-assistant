# 'Blast' Process Dialogue Examples

## Stage Progression Examples

### Moving from Ignore to Deny

**Manager**: "I've reviewed your project deliverables for Q3. You committed to 5 features but only delivered 2."

**Employee (Ignore)**: *Changes subject, talks about other work*

**Manager**: "Let's focus on the 3 missing features. Here are the emails where you committed to these dates." [Presents facts]

**Employee (Deny)**: "Those dates were never realistic. The requirements changed."

### Moving from Deny to Blame Others

**Manager**: "The requirements document shows no changes after your commitment. Here's the signed scope document." [Presents evidence]

**Employee (Blame Others)**: "Well, engineering didn't give me the resources I needed. And marketing kept changing their minds."

### Moving from Blame Others to Assume Responsibility

**Manager**: "I understand those challenges. But other engineers faced the same constraints and delivered. What could you have done differently?"

**Employee (Still blaming)**: "It's not my fault the system is broken."

**Manager**: "Let me be direct. Your performance is below expectations. Whether the system is broken or not, you're responsible for your deliverables. This is your performance issue."

**Employee (Assumes Responsibility)**: *Long pause* "I guess I should have escalated earlier. I should have asked for help."

### Moving to Find Solution

**Manager**: "Exactly. Now that we've identified that, what will you do differently next time?"

**Employee (Find Solution)**: "I'll set up weekly check-ins. I'll escalate blockers within 24 hours. I'll create a more detailed project plan."

## Fallback Procedure Example

**Manager**: "I understand you feel this isn't your fault and that other departments let you down. You may be right or I may be right about that."

**Employee**: "Then why am I being penalized?"

**Manager**: "Because I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions. And this is what I want you to do: Starting Monday, you will send me a daily status report. You will escalate any blocker within 4 hours. You will complete the remaining features by [date]. Do you understand?"

**Employee**: "I don't agree with this, but yes, I understand."

**Manager**: "Good. I'll be monitoring your performance against these commitments. Let's meet weekly to review progress."
