# Performance Review Principles and Protocols

## When to Use
- Conducting a performance review
- Evaluating a manager's performance
- Determining performance ratings
- Preparing written review documentation

## Fundamental Purpose of Performance Reviews

### Primary Goal
Improve the subordinate's performance through:
1. **Skill Level**: Identify missing skills and find ways to remedy them
2. **Motivation**: Intensify motivation to move the subordinate to a higher performance curve

### Secondary Purposes
- Assessing work, motivating, providing feedback
- Justifying raises, rewarding, discipline
- Direction, reinforcing culture

**Priority**: Always focus on performance improvement first.

## Time Offset and Long-Term Assessment

### Analyze Time Offset
- Determine if output in the review period is linked to activities in the same period
- Recognize that current output may be the "light from distant stars" (reflecting work done years ago)

### Judge Performance Based on Activities
- Give credit for strong activities even if tangible output is absent
- Do not penalize for lack of immediate output if building future capacity

### Apply Present Value Concept
- Estimate how much future-oriented activity will pay back over time
- Determine what that future value is worth today

## The Potential Trap Rule

### Assess Substance Over Form
- Evaluate actual performance and real output
- Ignore "potential" defined as form (knowledge, appearance, acting like a manager)

### Apply the Organization Cap
**RULE**: The performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the rating accorded to his organization.

### Enforce Consequences
- If the business unit lost money, missed forecasts, slipped schedules, or showed poor internal measures, the manager cannot receive a high rating
- Reject excuses that the organization failed but the manager is "outstanding"

## Review Integrity and Delivery Protocols

### Handling Self-Reviews
- Do not ask for a self-review if you intend to simply retype it and hand it back
- Preserve the integrity of your judgment by making an upfront assessment without being prompted by the subordinate

### Handling Upward Feedback
- You may ask the subordinate to evaluate your performance
- Clearly state that their assessment has only "advisory status"
- Never pretend you and subordinates are equals; you are the leader

### Timing of Written Review Delivery
**Recommended Approach**: Ensure the subordinate has time to work out their reactions to the review content before the discussion.

**Option A: During Discussion (Not Recommended)**
- Risk: Subordinate reads ahead instead of listening
- Risk: Subordinate cannot stop reading to discuss
- Risk: Subordinate has no time to think

**Option B: After Discussion (Not Recommended)**
- Risk: Subordinate may find a phrase they didn't "hear" earlier and react negatively

### Enforcing Quality
- If a review is superficial, lacks analysis, or lacks depth, insist on a rewrite
- The integrity of the performance review system is more important than the subordinate's preference
