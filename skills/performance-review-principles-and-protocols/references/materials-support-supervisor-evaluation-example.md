# Materials Support Supervisor Performance Evaluation Example

This example illustrates how to apply performance review principles to a specific management role.

## Core Responsibilities
- Managing the production planning process
- Managing the manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

## Evaluation Criteria

### Production Planning Performance
- Check for significant process changes during the review period
- Verify site coordination and administrative activity efficiency
- Rating: 'good' if sites are well coordinated and activities are efficiently done

### Manufacturing Specifications Performance

**Goal Setting Assessment**
- Determine if the employee defines 'clear, concise, and specific goals'
- *Negative Indicators*: Difficulty setting objectives; 'mushy' conclusions to system reviews; lack of definitive statement on system direction
- *Consequence*: Falling into the trap of 'working on' things without reaching objectives

**Meeting Effectiveness Assessment**
- Determine if the employee confuses holding meetings with actual progress
- *Negative Indicator*: Satisfaction that having a meeting on a subject constitutes progress
- *Corrective Action*: Employee must define specific results to accomplish *prior* to each meeting

### Strengths & Background Utilization
- Evaluate speed of learning (e.g., getting up to speed quickly to take over from predecessor)
- Evaluate utilization of prior background (e.g., finance) to assist other areas voluntarily

## Promotion Eligibility

**Current Status**: Promotion to next management level is denied if specific criteria are not met.

**Required Capabilities**
- Must be able to take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system) and show results
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of the way to achieve those goals

**Independence Requirement**: Employee must be the 'primary driver'; supervisor helps only when needed.

## Final Rating Determination
- **Meets Requirements**: Capable of doing current job, but acknowledging specific areas (goal setting, defining ways of accomplishing tasks) need improvement
- **Context Adjustment**: Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance
