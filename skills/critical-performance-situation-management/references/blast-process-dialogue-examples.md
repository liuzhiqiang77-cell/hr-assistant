# Blast Process Dialogue Examples

## Example 1: Moving Through the Stages

### Stage 2: Deny (Manager presents evidence)

**Manager**: "Over the past 6 months, your project has been late on every milestone. Here are the dates and the original schedule."

**Subordinate**: "I don't think that's accurate. We were only a week or two late, and that was because of external dependencies."

**Manager**: "Let me show you the project tracking data. Milestone 1 was due March 1, delivered March 15. Milestone 2 was due April 1, delivered April 22. That's 48 days of cumulative delay across 6 milestones. This isn't a couple of weeks."

### Stage 3: Blame Others (Manager counters)

**Subordinate**: "Well, the engineering team gave me bad specs. And marketing changed requirements at the last minute. How can I be on schedule when things keep changing?"

**Manager**: "I've reviewed the change logs. Marketing made one change request that was approved 3 weeks before the deadline. Engineering's specs were delivered on time per the schedule. And I notice that two other project managers faced the same constraints but still met their deadlines."

### Stage 4: Assume Responsibility (The breakthrough)

**Subordinate**: (Long pause, shoulders drop) "I guess... I guess I should have planned for those changes. I didn't account for the complexity. And I didn't escalate when I started falling behind."

**Manager**: "You're right. What does that mean?"

**Subordinate**: "It means... it's my problem. I need to do something different."

### Stage 5: Find Solution

**Subordinate**: "I think I need to build more buffer into my estimates. And I need to set up weekly checkpoints so I can catch issues earlier. Maybe I should get coaching on risk planning."

**Manager**: "Those all sound like good steps. Let's prioritize them and put together a 30-day plan."

## Example 2: Fallback Procedure

### Stuck at Blame Others

**Manager**: "We've been through the data. Your sales numbers are 40% below target for three consecutive quarters. You've missed your customer meetings, your pipeline is empty, and you're not following the sales process."

**Subordinate**: "That's because the economy is terrible. My customers aren't buying. The product has bugs. Marketing isn't generating good leads. This isn't my fault."

**Manager**: "I hear your concerns. But look at this data: The other five sales reps on your team are at 95% of target with the same economy, the same product, and the same leads. Your territory is actually the best in the company by historical performance."

**Subordinate**: "Well, they have different customers. Theirs are easier. This situation is unique. I'm still saying it's external."

**Manager**: (Shifts tone to formal) "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right. But I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions. Here is what I want you to do:"

"Starting tomorrow, you will:
1. Make 20 customer calls per day
2. Submit a pipeline report every Friday
3. Attend the weekly sales coaching session
4. Shadow your top-performing peer for 2 days"

"Do you understand these instructions?"

**Subordinate**: "Yes."

**Manager**: "Will you carry them out?"

**Subordinate**: "Yes."

**Manager**: "We'll review your progress in 30 days. Your continued employment depends on meeting these expectations."

## Key Insight: Emotional vs Intellectual

### "Assume Responsibility" is EMOTIONAL

> "When someone finally says 'It's my problem,' they're taking an emotional risk. They're admitting failure. They're facing the unpleasant reality that they have to do something difficult. This is the hardest step."

### "Find Solution" is INTELLECTUAL

> "Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is relatively easy. At that point, you're just brainstorming options and picking the best one. It's a mechanical process. The real work was getting to the point where the person was willing to do it."

### Don't Rush to Solutions

Many managers make the mistake of jumping straight to solutions: "Here's what you need to do to fix this."

**Problem**: The subordinate never really accepted the problem was theirs. They may nod, but they won't fully commit because they still believe it was someone else's fault.

**Better approach**: Guide them through the emotional breakthrough first. Wait until they say "It's my problem." Only then move to solutions.
