name: Critical Performance Situation Management
description: Handle extreme performance situations: guide subordinates through the 5-stage resistance cycle for turnaround situations (Blast process) and provide future-oriented development for high achievers. Use when dealing with subordinates requiring urgent performance turnaround to avoid firing, or high achievers needing continued development beyond retrospective assessment.

# Critical Performance Situation Management

Manage performance situations at both extremes: poor performers requiring urgent turnaround and high achievers needing developmental focus.

## When to Use
- **Blast Process**: Subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid termination
- **High Achiever Development**: Subordinate is a high performer and the review is focused only on past justification

## Situation A: Poor Performer Turnaround (The "Blast" Process)

### The 5-Stage Resistance Cycle

Subordinates in denial typically progress through these stages:

| Stage | Behavior | Manager's Action |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| 1. Ignore | Passive ignoring of the problem | Track stage; prepare evidence |
| 2. Deny | Active denial of problem's existence | Use facts/examples to demonstrate reality |
| 3. Blame Others | Admits problem exists but blames others | Use evidence to overcome resistance |
| 4. Assume Responsibility | "It is my problem" | **CRITICAL**: Guide through this emotional step |
| 5. Find Solution | Remedy the situation | Intellectual step - easier once responsibility accepted |

### Execution Steps

**1. Identify Current Stage**
- Observe the subordinate's language and behavior
- Track progression through the cycle

**2. Facilitate Progression**
- **Ignore → Deny**: Present facts and examples demonstrating reality
- **Deny → Blame Others**: Provide evidence countering external explanations
- **Blame Others → Assume Responsibility**: This is the **emotional breakthrough**. The subordinate realizes "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it," which implies work and unpleasantness. This is the biggest and hardest step.
- **Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**: Now a shared intellectual task

**3. Evaluate Possible Outcomes**
- **Outcome 1**: Subordinate accepts assessment AND recommended cure
- **Outcome 2**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment BUT accepts cure
- **Outcome 3**: Subordinate disagrees AND does not commit → Execute Fallback Procedure

### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at "Blame Others")

When the subordinate refuses to assume responsibility:

1. **Assume formal role**: "I am your boss, endowed with position power"
2. **State instruction clearly**: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do"
3. **Acknowledge disagreement**: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right"
4. **Assert organizational requirement**: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do"
5. **Secure commitment**: Get explicit commitment to the course of action
6. **Monitor performance**: Track against the commitment

## Situation B: High Achiever Development

### The Common Pitfall

Poor performers often receive detailed "corrective action programs" (step-by-step plans to meet minimum requirements). High achievers often receive reviews that are:
- Purely retrospective (analyzing what they did last year)
- Focused on justifying a high rating
- Lacking future-oriented development guidance

### The Opportunity

High achievers account for a **disproportionately large share of work**. Improving them is a **high-leverage activity** where the impact on group output is very great.

### Execution Steps

1. **Analyze current review content**: Is it retrospective or developmental?
2. **Identify the gap**: Are specific actions defined for future improvement?
3. **Shift the priority**: Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to:
   - Improve performance further
   - Maintain current excellence
   - Prepare for next-level challenges

### Rationale

> "Improving a high achiever by even a small percentage can yield enormous organizational returns, because high achievers handle the most critical work and influence others."
