# Structured Interviewing Process

## When to Use This Skill
Trigger this skill when:
- Preparing to conduct a job interview
- During the interview session with a candidate
- Planning reference checking activities
- Making final hiring decisions based on interview data

## Strategic Principles

### Define the Ultimate Purpose
Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance. Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit.

### Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks
- Do not use "tricks" (e.g., three-legged chair) to test character
- Be completely straightforward; show yourself and the environment as they really are
- A candidate is a potential employee—wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired

## Interview Execution

### Phase 1: Ask Specific Assessment Questions

Ask the following questions to evaluate different aspects of the candidate:

**Technical/Skills Assessment:**
- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"

**Application of Knowledge:**
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

**Operational Values and Fit:**
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"

### Phase 2: Utilize Direct Questions

Ask blunt questions to elicit direct answers and gauge confidence:
- Example: "How good are you technically?"

Observe:
- The candidate's immediate reaction
- The confidence vs. timidity of the response
- How well the response aligns with actual capability

### Phase 3: Employ Hypothetical Situations

Walk the candidate through specific processes or problems:
- Describe a relevant work process (e.g., manufacturing steps)
- Ask them to solve a specific problem
- Request a calculation or result derivation (e.g., finished cost of a product)

Evaluate:
- Problem-solving capacity
- Ability to derive principles on the fly
- Technical reasoning

### Phase 4: Invite Candidate Questions

Ask: "What would you like to know about me, the company, or the job?"

Analyze their questions to determine:
- What they already know about the role
- What they value in a position
- How prepared they are for the interview

## Reference Checking Protocol

### Goal
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly, through independent sources.

### Build Rapport
- **If you know the reference personally**: You have a better chance of getting "real" information
- **If the reference is a stranger**: Keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

### Timing Strategy
The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond. Allow adequate time for the reference check.

## Follow-Up Interviews

If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references:
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from reference checks
- Ask follow-up questions based on reference information
- Confirm or clarify any discrepancies

## Acknowledge Limitations

- Careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- It merely increases the odds of hiring well
- Accept that there is always risk in hiring decisions

## Expected Output

This process produces:
- Assessment of candidate's skills, values, and problem-solving capacity
- Evaluation of potential fit within your organization
- Reference-validated information about past performance
- Informed hiring decision with acknowledged risk
