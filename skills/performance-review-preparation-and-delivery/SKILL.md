# Performance Review Preparation and Delivery

## When to Use
- Preparing for performance reviews with mixed positive/negative assessments
- Delivering assessments to subordinates
- Reviewing performance against quarterly objectives
- Conducting formal performance evaluation sessions

## Preparation Phase

### 1. Data Scanning
Review all available material including:
- Progress reports
- Performance against quarterly objectives
- One-on-one meeting notes

### 2. Brainstorming (The Worksheet)
- Sit with a blank piece of paper
- Write "everything down" regarding the subordinate's performance
- "Do not edit in your head"
- Include "Things major, minor, and trivial" in no particular order
- Understand that writing items down does not commit you to doing anything

### 3. Documentation Removal
Once you run out of items, "put all of your supporting documentation away"

### 4. Relationship Analysis
Look for relationships between items on the worksheet. Identify if items are:
- "Different manifestations of the same phenomenon"
- Indications of why strengths/weaknesses exist

### 5. Message Formulation
Convert identified relationships into "messages" for the subordinate

### 6. Evidence Gathering
From the worksheet, "draw conclusions and specific examples to support them"

### 7. Filtering
Ask yourself if the subordinate will be able to remember all the messages chosen. If not, "delete the less important ones" (excluded items can be taken up in the next review)

### 8. Handling Surprises
- Ideally, regular supervision should prevent surprises
- If the worksheet reveals a message that "startles you", you must deliver it to improve performance
- Action: "Swallow hard and bring it up"

## Delivery Phase: The Three L's

### 1. Level
You must level with your subordinate:
- Be totally frank
- The credibility and integrity of the entire system depend on your being totally frank
- Praising someone straightforwardly can be just as hard as criticizing without embarrassment

### 2. Listen
Employ your entire arsenal of sensory capabilities:
- Goal: Transmit thoughts from your brain to theirs; words are just the means
- **Do NOT use a tape recorder** to confirm words used
- Identify barriers: Watch for signs the subordinate is:
  - Too emotional to understand clear points
  - Preoccupied trying to formulate answers rather than listening
  - Tuned out (defense mechanism)
- Verification techniques:
  - Watch the person you are talking to
  - Check for appropriate verbal and nonverbal responses
  - Check if they allow themselves to receive your message
- If not understood, explain again or in a different way
- Do not look away (like at a blackboard) to avoid confirming the presentation is murky

### 3. Leave Yourself Out
Ensure the review focuses solely on the subordinate:
- The performance review is about and for your subordinate
- Keep your own insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or other emotions out of it
- At issue are the subordinate's problems; it is the subordinate's day in court
- Control strong emotions (similar to stage fright) so they do not affect your task

## Expected Outcome
A delivered assessment where the message is confirmed as understood by the subordinate and the focus remains entirely on the subordinate's performance.
