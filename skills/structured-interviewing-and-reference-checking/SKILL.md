# Structured Interviewing and Reference Checking

## When to Use
- Conducting an interview session with a job candidate
- Planning interview strategy and approach
- Checking references after initial interviews
- Making final hiring decisions
- Conducting follow-up interviews

## Prerequisites
- Scheduled interview time
- Candidate resume and background information
- Completed initial interview (for reference checking)
- List of references (for reference checking)

## Conducting the Interview

### Ask Specific Assessment Questions
Use these core questions to evaluate the candidate:

1. **Past Performance**: "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
2. **Self-Awareness**: "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
3. **Value Proposition**: "Convince me why my company should hire you."
4. **Problem-Solving**: "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
5. **Readiness**: "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"
6. **Achievements**: "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

### Categorize Inquiries
Ensure comprehensive coverage by addressing these categories:
- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, technical capabilities, weaknesses
- **Application of Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures, learning experiences
- **Discrepancies**: Learning from failures, problems in current position
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new job, why the company should hire them

### Use Direct Questions
Ask blunt, direct questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?") to elicit straightforward answers. Observe the candidate's reaction, confidence level, and timidity to gauge actual capability.

### Employ Hypothetical Situations
Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps). Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result to discover their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly.

### Invite Candidate Questions
Ask the candidate what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job. Analyze their questions to determine what they already know, what they value, and how prepared they are.

## Reference Checking

### Establish Rapport
- If you know the reference personally, leverage that relationship to get real information
- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness
- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond

### Gather Information
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly. Cross-reference their self-assessment with external perspectives.

## Follow-up and Decision Making

### Conduct Follow-up Interviews
If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references. Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks.

### Define the Ultimate Purpose
Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance. Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit.

## Best Practices and Limitations

### Maintain Honesty
- Do not use tricks (e.g., three-legged chair) to test character
- Be completely straightforward; show yourself and the environment as they really are
- Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired

### Acknowledge Limitations
Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success. It merely increases the odds of making a good hiring decision. Accept the inherent risk in hiring decisions.
