## Example 1: Middle Manager Bonus Calculation

### Scenario
- **Total Compensation**: $150,000
- **Bonus Target**: 20% of total compensation
- **Bonus Factors**: Individual (50%), Team (30%), Corporate (20%)

### Calculation
1. **Total Bonus Pool**: $150,000 × 20% = $30,000
2. **Individual Performance** (Rated "Exceeds"): $30,000 × 50% × 120% = $18,000
3. **Team Performance** (Rated "Meets"): $30,000 × 30% × 100% = $9,000
4. **Corporate Performance** (Rated "Below"): $30,000 × 20% × 80% = $4,800
5. **Total Bonus**: $18,000 + $9,000 + $4,800 = $31,800

## Example 2: Senior Manager Bonus Calculation

### Scenario
- **Total Compensation**: $300,000
- **Bonus Target**: 40% of total compensation
- **Bonus Factors**: Individual (40%), Division (40%), Corporate (20%)

### Calculation
1. **Total Bonus Pool**: $300,000 × 40% = $120,000
2. **Individual Performance** (Rated "Outstanding"): $120,000 × 40% × 150% = $72,000
3. **Division Performance** (Rated "Exceeds"): $120,000 × 40% × 110% = $52,800
4. **Corporate Performance** (Rated "Meets"): $120,000 × 20% × 100% = $24,000
5. **Total Bonus**: $72,000 + $52,800 + $24,000 = $148,800

## Example 3: Salary Administration - Family of Curves
