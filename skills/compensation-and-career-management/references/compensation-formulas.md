# Compensation Design Formulas and Examples

## Bonus Calculation Example

**Scenario:** Middle Manager with $100,000 total compensation

**Bonus Structure:**
- Individual Performance: 7% of total comp
- Team Performance: 7% of total comp
- Corporate Performance: 6% of total comp
- **Total:** 20% bonus potential

**Payout:**
- If all factors met: $20,000 bonus
- If corporate factor missed: $14,000 bonus

## Salary Curve Comparison

**Experience-Only Curve:**
```
Salary = Base + (Years × Annual_Increment)
```
All employees follow same path.

**Merit-Based Curve (Family of Curves):**
```
Salary = Base + (Years × Annual_Increment × Performance_Multiplier)
```
- High performer: Multiplier = 1.5
- Average performer: Multiplier = 1.0
- Low performer: Multiplier = 0.5

## Promotion Timing Formula

**Optimal Promotion Window:**
- Employee must sustain "exceeds requirements" for minimum 6-12 months
- Promotion should occur before atrophy sets in (typically within 18 months of exceeding)

**Atrophy Risk:**
```
Atrophy_Risk = (Time_Since_Exceeding ÷ 18) × 100%
```
