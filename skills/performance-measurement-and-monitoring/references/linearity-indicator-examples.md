# Linearity Indicator Examples

## Recruiting Campaign Example

**Scenario**: Hiring 50 graduates by June, starting in January

**Progress by Month**:
- January: 3 hires (Behind: Target ~8)
- February: 5 hires total (Behind: Target ~16)
- March: 12 hires total (Behind: Target ~25)
- April: 18 hires total (Behind: Target ~33)

**Analysis**: At April, need 32 more hires in 2 months (16/month) to hit 50 by June. Much higher rate than achieved so far.

**Action**: Immediate corrective action required—increase recruiting resources or adjust expectations.

## Manufacturing Example

**Scenario**: Monthly production target of 10,000 units

**Weekly Production**:
- Week 1: 1,000 units
- Week 2: 1,500 units
- Week 3: 2,000 units
- Week 4: 5,500 units

**Analysis**: Back-loaded production. Resources underutilized early, rushed at end.

**Action**: Rebalance schedule to spread production evenly. Risk of breakdown increases when rushing at month-end.
