# Performance Problem Resolution

## The 'Blast' Performance Review Process

Use this when a subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing.

### The Resistance Cycle

Identify and track the subordinate's current stage:

1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others to avoid responsibility
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation

### Facilitating Progression

Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality at each stage:

- **Ignore → Deny**: Use facts to demonstrate reality
- **Deny → Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance
- **Blame Others → Assume Responsibility**: Guide the subordinate to take the "biggest step"
  - **Key Insight**: This is an emotional step where the subordinate realizes "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"—which implies work and unpleasantness
- **Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**: Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared task and is relatively easier (intellectual step)

### Possible Outcomes

1. Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
2. Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
3. Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')

1. **Assume formal role** of the supervisor endowed with position power
2. **State clearly**: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. **Acknowledge disagreement**: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. **Assert organizational requirement**: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. **Secure commitment** to the course of action
6. **Monitor performance** against that commitment

### Critical Distinction

- **Assuming Responsibility** = Emotional step (hard)
- **Finding Solution** = Intellectual step (easier)

## High Achiever Development Strategy

Use this when a subordinate is a high achiever identified during the performance review process.

### Common Pitfall

Supervisors often spend effort justifying the judgment of superior performance while giving little attention to how the subordinate could do even better. Poor performers often receive detailed "corrective action programs," whereas high achievers often lack future-oriented guidance.

### Development Strategy

1. **Analyze current review content**: Determine if it's purely a retrospective assessment or focused on justifying a high rating

2. **Shift the priority**: Define specific actions the subordinate needs to take to improve performance or maintain their current level

3. **Rationale**: High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a **high-leverage activity** where the impact on group output is very great.

### Execution

- Do NOT focus only on past justification
- Provide specific steps for future improvement
- Recognize this as a high-leverage activity for organizational output

## When to Use This Skill

- Conducting performance reviews for underperformers at risk of termination
- Facilitating performance turnaround discussions
- Managing resistance to feedback or performance issues
- Developing high achievers during performance reviews
- Maximizing the impact of top performers on organizational output

## Constraints

- The Blast process cannot proceed to solution-finding if subordinate is stuck in denial or blame stages
- High achiever development does not apply to poor performers who require corrective action programs
