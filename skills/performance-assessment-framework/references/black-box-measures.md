# Black Box Assessment - Detailed Reference

## The Black Box Metaphor

**Visual Model**:
```
Input → [BLACK BOX: Employee] → Output
         ↑                    ↑
    Internal Measures    Output Measures
```

**The Employee as Black Box**:
- We cannot directly see inside the employee's mind
- We can observe inputs (resources, direction, support)
- We can observe outputs (results, deliverables)
- Internal measures are our window into the box

## Weighting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Crisis Management (90/10 Output/Internal)

**Context**: Company facing immediate threat, need for quick results

**Rationale**: Survival depends on immediate output; long-term activities are secondary

**Focus**: Immediate problem resolution, crisis response, stabilization

### Scenario 2: Balanced Performance (50/50 Output/Internal)

**Context**: Steady-state operations, normal business conditions

**Rationale**: Both current results and future capability are important

**Focus**: Meeting current targets, building for the future, sustainable performance

### Scenario 3: Development Focus (30/70 Output/Internal)

**Context**: High-potential employee in development program

**Rationale**: Investment in future capability justifies lower immediate output expectations

**Focus**: Learning and skill development, building relationships, understanding the business

## Trade-off Analysis Examples

### Trade-off 1: Short-term vs. Long-term

**Situation**: Employee delivered excellent short-term results but did not invest in team development.

**Analysis**:
- Output Score: 9/10 (exceeded targets)
- Internal Score: 4/10 (minimal development activities)
- Trade-off: Prioritized immediate results over future capability
- Assessment: Strong performance now, but sustainability risk

### Trade-off 2: Individual vs. Team

**Situation**: Employee achieved excellent individual results but undermined team collaboration.

**Analysis**:
- Output Score: 9/10 (individual targets met)
- Internal Score: 5/10 (poor collaboration, knowledge hoarding)
- Trade-off: Individual success at expense of team effectiveness
- Assessment: Good individual contributor, poor team player
