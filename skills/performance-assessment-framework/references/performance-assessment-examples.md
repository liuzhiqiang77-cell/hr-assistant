# Performance Assessment Examples

## Weighting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Crisis Management (90/10)
- **Output Measures (90%)**: Immediate results are critical
- **Internal Measures (10%)**: Future building is secondary to survival
- **Context**: Company turnaround, urgent deadline

### Scenario 2: Leadership Development (50/50)
- **Output Measures (50%)**: Current performance matters
- **Internal Measures (50%)**: Building team capability is equally important
- **Context**: Manager role, team growth phase

### Scenario 3: Strategic Planning (10/90)
- **Output Measures (10%)**: Immediate tangible output is minimal
- **Internal Measures (90%)**: Future positioning is the primary value
- **Context**: Research role, long-term project initiation
