# Performance Assessment Framework

## When to Use
- Conducting performance reviews for subordinates
- Evaluating employee contributions over a period
- Making promotion or compensation decisions
- Balancing short-term results with long-term capability building

## Core Concept: The Black Box Model
Performance assessment evaluates both the output produced (what comes out of the black box) and the activities that create output and build future capability (what happens inside the black box).

## Assessment Procedure

### Step 1: Define Expectations
Clarify in advance what is expected from the subordinate to ensure assessment against standards, not arbitrary judgment.

### Step 2: Evaluate Output Measures (The Output of the Black Box)
Assess tangible results that can be plotted on charts:
- Completing designs
- Meeting sales quotas
- Increasing production yield
- Delivering projects on time/budget

### Step 3: Evaluate Internal Measures (Inside the Black Box)
Assess activities in two categories:

**Current Output Creation**:
- Activities creating output for the current period
- Day-to-day task execution
- Problem-solving for immediate issues

**Future Capability Building**:
- Activities setting the stage for future output
- Positioning and developing people
- Ensuring department health to prevent future disgruntlement
- Process improvements that will pay off later

### Step 4: Determine Weighting
- **No strict formula** exists for comparing significance
- Weighting is situational and can shift (e.g., 50/50, 90/10, 10/90)
- Consider organizational context, role requirements, and current priorities

### Step 5: Trade-off Analysis
Explicitly identify which variables are being traded off against each other in the final assessment.

## Constraints
- Difficult to apply strictly objectively to professional work
- Requires clear expectations defined in advance
- Subjective judgment is necessary for internal measures

## Output
A balanced performance score based on weighted output and internal measures, with explicit documentation of trade-offs made.
