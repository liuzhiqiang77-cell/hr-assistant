# Candidate Interview Assessment Techniques

## When to Use
- Conducting an interview session with a job candidate
- Need to evaluate technical capabilities, problem-solving skills, and cultural fit
- Want to assess candidate's readiness and potential contribution
- Time is limited (typically 1-2 hours)

## Prerequisites
- Scheduled interview time
- Candidate resume and background information

## Assessment Process

### 1. Ask Core Assessment Questions
Pose these specific questions to evaluate different aspects of the candidate:

**Projects and Recognition:**
- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."

**Self-Awareness and Growth:**
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"

**Value Proposition:**
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."

**Problem-Solving and Prevention:**
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"

**Readiness:**
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"

**Achievements:**
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

### 2. Categorize Inquiries for Coverage
Ensure comprehensive assessment by covering these categories:

- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, technical weaknesses
- **Application of Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures and learnings
- **Discrepancies**: Learning from failures, addressing current problems
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new role, alignment with company needs

### 3. Use Direct Questions
- Ask blunt, direct questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?")
- Observe the candidate's reaction and response confidence
- Gauge actual capability through the confidence/timidity of their answer

### 4. Employ Hypothetical Situations
- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job
- Ask them to solve a concrete problem or calculate a result
- Evaluate their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly

### 5. Invite Candidate Questions
- Ask what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job
- Analyze their questions to determine:
  - What they already know about the role
  - What they value in a position
  - How prepared they are for the interview

## Output
An evaluation of the candidate's:
- Technical skills and capabilities
- Problem-solving approach and capacity
- Values and operational fit
- Self-awareness and growth mindset
- Overall potential contribution to the organization
