# Performance Diagnosis: Can't vs. Won't

Diagnose the root cause of performance failures to select the correct managerial intervention.

## When to Use
- An employee is not performing their job duties
- Performance issues persist despite previous interventions
- You need to determine whether to apply training or motivation strategies
- Root cause appears to be within the individual's control

## Prerequisites
- Observation of poor performance or failure to do the job
- Confirmation that the issue is not external (e.g., equipment failure)

## Diagnostic Process

### Step 1: Identify the Performance Issue
Clearly define what work is not being done.

### Step 2: Apply the "Life or Death" Mental Test
Ask yourself: **"If this person's life depended on doing the work, could they do it?"**

### Step 3: Evaluate the Answer

**IF the answer is YES:**
- The person is capable but not motivated
- Diagnosis: **"Won't do it"** (Motivation issue)
- Intervention: Apply motivation strategies

**IF the answer is NO:**
- The person is not capable
- Diagnosis: **"Can't do it"** (Capability issue)
- Intervention: Provide training

### Step 4: Select the Managerial Intervention
- For **Capability issues**: Use Training
- For **Motivation issues**: Use Motivation strategies

## Key Principle
These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job. All other interventions are useless unless the individual tries to offer their best.

## Constraints
- Does not apply if the root cause is external to the individual (e.g., equipment failure, market conditions)
