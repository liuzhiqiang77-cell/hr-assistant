# Maslow's Hierarchy - Detailed Reference

## Need Level Details

### Physiological Needs
- **Definition**: Basic necessities of life that money can buy
- **Driver**: Fear of deprivation (starvation, homelessness)
- **Example**: Dickens-era workers avoiding starvation
- **Money role**: Utilitarian resource to buy necessities

### Safety/Security Needs
- **Definition**: Desire to protect oneself from slipping back to deprivation
- **Driver**: Protection against catastrophic loss
- **Example**: Medical insurance preventing bankruptcy from hospital fees
- **Note**: Rarely dominant but absence badly affects performance

### Social/Affiliation Needs
- **Definition**: Inherent desire to belong to a group with common traits
- **Driver**: Companionship and team identity
- **Example**: Taking low-paying job for colleague companionship
- **Key insight**: "Misery loves not just any company, but the company of other miserable people"

### Esteem/Recognition Needs
- **Definition**: Desire to keep up with or emulate a specific person or group
- **Driver**: Recognition from a specific reference group
- **Example**: Athlete greeting a top player (means nothing to family)
- **Limitation**: Self-limiting - once goal reached (e.g., becoming VP), need loses urgency

### Self-Actualization
- **Definition**: Need to achieve one's "utter personal best" in a chosen field
- **Key characteristic**: Does not extinguish after fulfillment
- **Driver types**:
  - *Competence-driven*: Job/task mastery (violinist practicing)
  - *Achievement-driven*: Testing limits of capability in all endeavors
- **Money role**: Scorecard for success, boundless motivation

## Edge Cases

### Regressive Movement
If environment changes drastically (earthquake, economic collapse), individuals can instantly regress from high-level needs to fundamental survival needs.

### Concurrent Needs
People have multiple needs simultaneously, but one dominates behavior at any given time.
