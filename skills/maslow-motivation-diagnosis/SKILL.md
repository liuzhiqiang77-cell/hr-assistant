# Maslow-Based Motivation Diagnosis

## Hierarchy Overview

**Chain of Causality:** Needs → Drives → Motivation

**Hierarchy Levels (lowest to highest):**
1. Physiological
2. Security/Safety
3. Social/Affiliation
4. Esteem/Recognition
5. Self-Actualization

## Dynamic Rules

**Satiation Rule:**
- A need once satisfied stops being a need and stops motivating
- To maintain high motivation, keep some needs unsatisfied at all times

**Dominance Principle:**
- People have multiple concurrent needs
- One need is always stronger than the others
- The dominant need determines motivation and performance level

**Hierarchical Progression:**
- When a lower need is satisfied, a higher need likely takes over

**Regressive Movement (Edge Case):**
- Drastic environmental changes (e.g., earthquake) can cause instant regression to fundamental needs

## Need Level Characteristics

### Physiological Needs
- **Definition:** Basic necessities of life (food, clothing) that money can buy
- **Driver:** Fear of deprivation (starvation)
- **Example:** Working to avoid starvation

### Security/Safety Needs
- **Definition:** Desire to protect oneself from slipping back to deprivation
- **Driver:** Protection against catastrophic loss
- **Example:** Medical insurance protecting against bankruptcy
- **Note:** Rarely dominant, but absence badly affects performance

### Social/Affiliation Needs
- **Definition:** Inherent desire to belong to a group with common traits
- **Driver:** Companionship and team identity
- **Example:** Taking low-paying job for colleague companionship

### Esteem/Recognition Needs
- **Definition:** Desire to keep up with or emulate a specific person or group
- **Driver:** Recognition from a specific reference group
- **Note:** "Esteem exists in the eyes of the beholder"
- **Limitation:** Self-limiting—once goal reached, loses urgency

### Self-Actualization
- **Definition:** Need to achieve one's "utter personal best"
- **Key Characteristic:** Does NOT extinguish after fulfillment; drives to ever higher levels

## Money Motivation Diagnostic Test

Use this test when analyzing an employee's reaction to compensation changes:

**Step 1:** Observe reaction to salary increase
- **Scenario A:** Employee focuses on the ABSOLUTE SUM received
- **Scenario B:** Employee focuses on the RELATIVE COMPARISON against others

**Step 2:** Determine motivation mode
- **If Scenario A (Absolute Sum):** Motivated by Physiological or Safety needs
  - Money = utilitarian resource for necessities
  - Motivation ceases when monetary target is met
  - Example: Plant workers quitting after reaching savings goal
- **If Scenario B (Relative Comparison):** Motivated by Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization
  - Money = measure of achievement/scorecard
  - Motivation is boundless
  - Example: Venture Capitalists ("second ten million is just as important")

**Step 3:** Interpret result
- **Lower levels:** Money satisfies a deficit need
- **Upper levels:** Money satisfies a growth need
