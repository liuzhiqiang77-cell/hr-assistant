# Money Motivation Examples

## Case Study: Caribbean Plant Workers

Workers were motivated to earn enough money to reach a specific savings goal. Once they reached that target, they quit working. The money served a purely utilitarian purpose (safety/security need), and motivation ceased when the need was satisfied.

## Case Study: Venture Capitalists

Venture capitalists often continue working aggressively despite having substantial wealth. Each additional deal or dollar earned is viewed as another "win" or achievement score. The money serves as a measure of success and recognition (esteem/self-actualization need), creating boundless motivation.

## Management Implications

### For Utilitarian-Motivated Employees
- Set clear compensation targets tied to specific outcomes
- Understand that motivation may drop once targets are reached
- Consider non-monetary rewards for sustained engagement

### For Achievement-Motivated Employees
- Use compensation as a recognition and ranking tool
- Emphasize relative standing and achievement milestones
- Money serves as a scorecard; ensure the scoring system is clear and competitive
