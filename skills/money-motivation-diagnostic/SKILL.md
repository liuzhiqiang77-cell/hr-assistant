# Money Motivation Diagnostic

## When to Use
- Analyzing an employee's reaction to a raise or compensation change
- Determining whether money serves as a utilitarian need or achievement measure
- Designing effective compensation strategies
- Understanding why motivation ceases after reaching financial targets

## Diagnostic Procedure

### Step 1: Observe Reaction to Salary Increase
Assess which of the following scenarios applies:

**Scenario A**: The individual focuses on the **ABSOLUTE SUM** of money received
- Example: "I got $10,000 more—that's enough to buy a house/car/pay off debt"

**Scenario B**: The individual focuses on the **RELATIVE COMPARISON** against others
- Example: "Did I get more than John? Is this a fair percentage compared to my peers?"

### Step 2: Determine Motivation Mode

**If Scenario A (Absolute Sum)**:
- **Mode**: Physiological or Safety needs
- **Reasoning**: Money is viewed as a utilitarian resource to buy necessities or reach a predetermined standard of living
- **Limitation**: Motivation ceases once the specific monetary target is met
- **Example**: Caribbean plant workers quitting after reaching a savings goal

**If Scenario B (Relative Comparison)**:
- **Mode**: Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization
- **Reasoning**: Money is viewed as a "measure of achievement" rather than a utilitarian need
- **Characteristic**: Motivation is boundless; the "second ten million" is just as important as the first
- **Example**: Venture Capitalists driven by achievement scores

### Step 3: Interpret the Result
- **Lower Levels**: Money satisfies a deficit need (once filled, motivation stops)
- **Upper Levels**: Money satisfies a growth need and serves as a scorecard for success (motivation continues)

## Constraints
- Does not apply if compensation is not a factor
- Cultural differences in standard of living may affect "expected level"
- Individual circumstances may temporarily shift focus (e.g., financial crisis)

## Output
Employee is operating in [Motivation Mode] where money acts as [Utilitarian Resource OR Measure of Achievement].
