# Promotion Cycle Examples

## Example 1: Successful Promotion Cycle

**Year 1-2: Software Engineer (Job 1)**
- Performance: Meets requirements
- Action: Training, mentorship

**Year 3: Software Engineer (Job 1)**
- Performance: Exceeds requirements
- Action: Promoted to Senior Engineer (Job 2)

**Year 3-4: Senior Engineer (Job 2)**
- Performance: Meets requirements (learning new responsibilities)
- Action: Experience, challenging assignments

**Year 5: Senior Engineer (Job 2)**
- Performance: Exceeds requirements
- Action: Promoted to Tech Lead (Job 3)

**Year 5-6: Tech Lead (Job 3)**
- Performance: Meets requirements
- Action: Leadership training

**Year 7: Tech Lead (Job 3)**
- Performance: Meets requirements (plateaued)
- Action: No promotion—reached level of competence

## Example 2: Atrophy Risk

**Year 1-3: Account Manager**
- Performance: Exceeds requirements
- Action: **No promotion available** (budget constraints)

**Year 4: Account Manager**
- Performance: Drops to "meets requirements"
- Cause: Atrophy from lack of new challenges
- Risk: Employee may leave for growth opportunity

**Corrective Action**: 
- Create special project or lateral move
- Promote to Senior Account Manager
- Or accept attrition risk

## Example 3: Failed Promotion → Recycling

**Before Promotion**:
- Role: Senior Developer
- Performance: Exceeds requirements consistently
- Promotion: Engineering Manager

**After Promotion (6 months)**:
- Role: Engineering Manager
- Performance: Below average
- Issues: Struggles with people management, delegation

**Decision**: Recycling

**Recycling Process**:
1. Manager admits misjudgment
2. Honest conversation with employee
3. Return to Senior Developer role
4. Support through embarrassment
5. Clear path: "You're excellent technically. Let's build on that. Management path remains open if you're interested later."

**Outcome (1 year later)**:
- Performance: Exceeds requirements as Senior Developer
- Confidence: Restored
- Future: Promoted to Principal Architect (technical track)
