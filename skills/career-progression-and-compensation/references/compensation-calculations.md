# Compensation Calculation Examples

## Example 1: Middle Manager Bonus Calculation

**Scenario:** Middle Manager with $150,000 total compensation

**Bonus Percentage:** 20% of total compensation
**Bonus Pool:** $150,000 × 20% = $30,000

**3-Factor Split:**
1. Individual Performance (50%): $30,000 × 50% = $15,000
2. Team Objective Performance (30%): $30,000 × 30% = $9,000
3. Corporate Financial Performance (20%): $30,000 × 20% = $6,000

**Actual Payout Calculation:**
- Individual rating: "Exceeds" = 120% of target = $15,000 × 1.2 = $18,000
- Team objective: Met 95% = $9,000 × 0.95 = $8,550
- Corporate result: Exceeded target = $6,000 × 1.1 = $6,600

**Total Bonus:** $18,000 + $8,550 + $6,600 = $33,150

## Example 2: Senior Manager Bonus Calculation

**Scenario:** Senior Manager with $400,000 total compensation

**Bonus Percentage:** 40% of total compensation
**Bonus Pool:** $400,000 × 40% = $160,000

**3-Factor Split:**
1. Individual Performance (40%): $160,000 × 40% = $64,000
2. Division Performance (40%): $160,000 × 40% = $64,000
3. Corporate Financial Performance (20%): $160,000 × 20% = $32,000

**Actual Payout Calculation:**
- Individual rating: "Meets" = 100% of target = $64,000
- Division objective: Exceeded by 15% = $64,000 × 1.15 = $73,600
- Corporate result: Missed by 5% = $32,000 × 0.95 = $30,400

**Total Bonus:** $64,000 + $73,600 + $30,400 = $168,000

## Example 3: Salary Administration - Family of Curves

**Scenario:** Three employees hired at same time with same starting salary: $80,000

**After 5 years:**

**Employee A (High Performer):**
- Experience curve: $95,000 (5 years at 3% annual)
- Merit adjustment: +$25,000
- Actual salary: $120,000

**Employee B (Average Performer):**
- Experience curve: $95,000
- Merit adjustment: +$5,000
- Actual salary: $100,000

**Employee C (Below Average):**
- Experience curve: $95,000
- Merit adjustment: -$10,000
- Actual salary: $85,000

**Note:** All three have 5 years of experience, but performance differences create significant salary divergence while staying within reasonable bounds of the experience curve.
