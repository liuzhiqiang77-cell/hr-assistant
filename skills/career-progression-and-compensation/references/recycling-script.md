# Employee Recycling Conversation Script

## Opening

> "[Name], I want to have an honest conversation about your performance as Engineering Manager over the past six months."

## Present Reality

> "When we promoted you to this role, we saw your technical excellence and thought you'd transition well to management. However, the people management aspects have proven more challenging than we anticipated. Your team's performance and morale have suffered."

## Take Responsibility

> "I need to be clear: this is my fault. I misjudged your readiness for this role. I should have provided more management training or considered a different path. I pushed you into a position that wasn't the right fit at this time."

## Propose Solution

> "I want to propose something: let's move you back to the Senior Developer role where you were excelling. This isn't a punishment—it's putting you back where you can be successful and contribute your best."

## Address Concerns

> "I know this feels like a step backward. It's embarrassing—I get that. But here's what I want you to know: we value you. Your technical skills are exceptional. The team respects your engineering judgment."

## Commit to Support

> "We'll handle this openly. I'll communicate to the team that you're returning to focus on technical leadership, which is where your strengths lie. I'll make it clear this was a management decision about role fit, not a reflection on your capabilities."

## Future Path

> "This doesn't close doors. If you're interested in management later, we can provide training and consider it again. Or there's the technical track—Principal Architect, Technical Fellow—where you can have huge impact without direct reports."

## Close

> "What do you think? I want you in a role where you can succeed and feel good about your work. I believe that's as a Senior Developer right now. Are you willing to give that a try?"
