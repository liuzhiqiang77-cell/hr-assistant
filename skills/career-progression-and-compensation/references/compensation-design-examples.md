# Compensation Design Examples

## Example 1: Middle Manager Compensation Package

**Role**: Engineering Manager
**Total Compensation**: $150,000

### Bonus Structure (20% of total = $30,000)

| Factor | Weight | Potential Amount |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Individual Performance | 50% | $15,000 |
| Department Objectives | 30% | $9,000 |
| Corporate Financial Results | 20% | $6,000 |

### Base Salary Administration

- Starting point: $120,000 (industry standard for role)
- Merit curve adjustment: +$10,000 (above-average performance)
- Experience adjustment: +$20,000 (8 years in role)
- **Final Base Salary**: $150,000

## Example 2: Senior Manager Compensation Package

**Role**: Director of Marketing
**Total Compensation**: $300,000

### Bonus Structure (40% of total = $120,000)

| Factor | Weight | Potential Amount |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Individual Performance | 40% | $48,000 |
| Division Objectives | 40% | $48,000 |
| Corporate Financial Results | 20% | $24,000 |

### Rationale for Higher Percentage

- Higher earners have less material utility for incremental dollars
- Higher percentage needed for meaningful feedback
- Avoids hardship from bonus fluctuations

## Example 3: Promotion Cycle in Action

**Employee**: Software Engineer

| Year | Role | Performance | Action |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Junior Engineer | Meets Requirements | Training provided |
| 2 | Junior Engineer | Exceeds Requirements | Promoted to Senior Engineer |
| 3 | Senior Engineer | Meets Requirements | New challenges, learning curve |
| 4 | Senior Engineer | Exceeds Requirements | Promoted to Tech Lead |
| 5 | Tech Lead | Meets Requirements | Settled at level |
| 6+ | Tech Lead | Meets Requirements | No further promotion (level of competence) |

## Example 4: Employee Recycling Scenario

**Situation**: Promoted Sales Manager struggling after 6 months

**Background**:
- Was top-performing Sales Representative
- Promoted to manage 5-person team
- Team performance declining, missing quotas
- Employee stressed and considering quitting

**Recycling Process**:
1. Management acknowledges misjudgment of readiness
2. Honest conversation: "We moved you too fast"
3. Offer return to Senior Sales Representative role
4. Maintain salary (no pay cut)
5. Public announcement: "John is returning to sales to focus on key accounts"
6. Provide coaching and support

**Outcome**:
- John regains confidence in 3 months
- Becomes top performer again
- Promoted to Sales Manager 18 months later
- Succeeds in second attempt

## Key Principle: Task-Relevant Feedback

Compensation should provide feedback on performance. The timing and structure of bonuses must be close enough to the work that the subordinate understands the connection between their actions and the reward.
