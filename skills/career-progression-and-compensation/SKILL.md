# Career Progression and Compensation

## When to Use
- Designing or reviewing compensation structures for middle/senior managers
- Evaluating employees for promotion based on performance ratings
- Managing employees who are struggling after a promotion
- Making decisions about demotion vs termination

## Middle Manager Compensation System Design

### Performance Bonus (Variable Pay)

#### Determine Bonus Percentage
| Role | Bonus as % of Total Compensation |
|------|----------------------------------|
| Middle Manager | 10% - 25% |
| Senior Manager | Up to 50% |

**Rationale**: Higher earners have less material utility for incremental dollars; higher percentage needed for feedback while avoiding hardship from fluctuations.

#### Define Bonus Factors
Identify if performance is team-based or individual-based. Recommended 3-factor split:

1. **Individual Performance** (judged by supervisor)
2. **Immediate Team Objective Performance** (e.g., department goals)
3. **Overall Corporate Financial Performance**

#### Establish Timing
- Pay bonus close enough to work time so subordinate remembers why it was awarded
- Account for cause/effect time offsets

#### Select Metrics
- **Countable items**: Financial metrics
- **Measurable objectives**: Specific KPIs
- **Subjective elements**: Use with caution—may lead to "beauty contest"

### Salary Administration (Base Pay)

#### Select Administration Scheme

| Scheme | Description | Verdict |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Experience-Only | Pay based strictly on time (X time = Y pay) | Easiest, but ignores merit |
| Merit-Only | Pay based on performance only | Impractical—hard to ignore experience |
| Compromise (Recommended) | "Family of curves"—starts everyone same, different speeds/destinations | Best balance |

#### Implement Competitive Ranking
- Accept that merit-based systems require competitive, comparative evaluation
- Principle: If someone is first, someone else must be last (similar to sports rankings)

## Promotion Performance Cycle Logic

### The Performance-Promotion Cycle

1. **Initial State**: Employee at Job 1 performing at "meets requirements" (average level)
2. **Improvement Phase**: Training and motivation improve performance to "exceeds requirements" (above-average)
3. **Promotion Trigger**: Employee "exceeds requirements" → considered "promotable" → promoted to Job 2
4. **Performance Reset**: In Job 2, employee initially performs at "meets requirements" due to new challenges
5. **Cycle Repetition**: With experience, employee improves to "exceeds requirements" → another promotion
6. **Cycle Conclusion**: Employee settles at "meets requirements" and is no longer promoted (reaching "level of incompetence")

### Critical Constraint
If an employee "exceeds the requirements" but is **NOT promoted** to greater challenges, they will **atrophy** and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements."

### Promotion Decision Matrix

| Current Performance | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| Meets requirements | Maintain current level |
| Exceeds requirements | Evaluate for promotion |
| Below requirements | Performance improvement plan |

## Employee Recycling Procedure

### When to Use
- Employee has been promoted
- Employee is performing below-average for extended period in new role
- Employee performed well in previous role

### The Recycling Process

1. **Identification**: Recognize the person has been promoted "so much over their head" that they perform below-average
2. **Solution Selection**: Choose to "recycle" rather than terminate
3. **Definition**: Put the employee back in the job they did well before the promotion
4. **Management Accountability**: Admit management was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness"
5. **Implementation**: Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do
6. **Support System**: Support the employee through likely embarrassment
7. **Transparency**: Execute recycling "openly" to reduce stigma
8. **Expected Outcome**: Embarrassment will be "short-lived"; employee regains confidence
9. **Future Value**: Once confident, employee becomes "excellent candidate for another promotion"

### Prohibited Action
**Do NOT force the employee to leave the company.**

Reject the rationalization: "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake."

### Challenges
- **Societal stigma**: Demotion carries negative perception
- **Management tendency**: View recycling as personal failure
- **Emotional impact**: Employee embarrassment

### Benefits
- Retains valuable talent
- Employee likely to succeed in future promotion
- Builds trust in management's fairness
- Reduces turnover costs
