# MBO Implementation Reference

## Goal Setting Principles

### The 50% Rule
Set objectives where the individual has only a "fifty-fifty chance" of making them, even if they push hard.

### Rationale
- Output tends to be greater when striving for a level beyond immediate grasp
- Even with 50% failure rate, overall performance increases
- Forces individuals to work at their capability boundary

### Implementation Steps
1. Define clear, measurable objectives
2. Assess current capability level
3. Set target 50% above current capability
4. Provide resources and support
5. Track progress regularly
6. Adjust goals based on performance

## Culture Transformation

### From Knowledge-Centered to Output-Centered

**Knowledge-Centered Culture Signs**
- Valuing who knows what over who produces what
- Long meetings with abstract discussions
- Recognition for expertise without application
- "I know" valued more than "I did"

**Output-Centered Culture Signs**
- Tangible results are primary metric
- Abstract knowledge must be applied to be valued
- Recognition tied to deliverables
- "I delivered" valued more than "I know"

### Transition Strategies
1. Redefine success metrics around output
2. Change recognition systems
3. Lead by example (managers must produce)
4. Celebrate tangible wins publicly
5. De-emphasize theoretical discussions without action plans
