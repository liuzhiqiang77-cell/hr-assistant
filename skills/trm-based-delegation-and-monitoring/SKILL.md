# TRM-Based Delegation and Monitoring

## Establish Foundation: Operational Values

Before delegating effectively, you must establish shared operational values with your subordinates.

**Critical Principle**: The supervisor is accountable for subordinate output. You cannot delegate without a shared set of values.

1. **Transmit Common Values**:
   - Teach subordinates the correct way to do things
   - Share organizational priorities and preferences
   - Explain how the organization works together

2. **Prevent Customer Tuition**:
   - Never allow subordinates to learn by making mistakes paid for by customers
   - Assume responsibility for teaching operational values early
   - Structure moves from externally imposed (by you) to internally adopted (by subordinate)

3. **Internalization Process**:
   - As TRM grows, structure becomes internally adopted
   - Managerial style progresses from close supervision to delegation

## Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

TRM is NOT general maturity—it is specific to the task at hand.

**TRM = Achievement Orientation + Readiness for Responsibility + Experience/Education**

1. **Evaluate Specific Factors**:
   - Achievement orientation: How driven is the subordinate?
   - Readiness for responsibility: Willingness to be accountable
   - Education and training: Relevant background for this specific task
   - Experience: Past performance with this specific work

2. **Recognize TRM Specificity**:
   - A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another
   - TRM can drop if pace accelerates or job abruptly changes
   - Even seasoned managers have low TRM in new environments

3. **Determine TRM Level**:
   - **Low**: New to task, needs close supervision
   - **Medium/Growing**: Some experience, transitioning
   - **High**: Experienced with specific task, ready for delegation

## Delegate Strategically

**Key Principle**: Delegation without follow-through is abdication.

1. **Prerequisite Check**:
   - Ensure you and the delegatee share a common information base
   - Verify shared operational values exist
   - Without these, delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage

2. **Select Tasks**:
   - Delegate tasks you are FAMILIAR with (easier to monitor)
   - Avoid delegating unfamiliar tasks initially
   - Be honest with yourself about tasks you're emotionally attached to

3. **Assign and Retain Responsibility**:
   - Never wash your hands of the task
   - You remain responsible for its accomplishment
   - Your role shifts from doing to ensuring

## Monitor Based on TRM

Monitoring is NOT meddling. It's quality assurance that ensures results.

### Quality Assurance Principles

1. **Monitor at Lowest-Added-Value Stage**:
   - Review rough drafts, not final polished versions
   - Catch basic content problems before expensive polishing
   - Example: Review outline, not completed report

2. **Use Sampling, Not 100% Inspection**:
   - Check details randomly
   - Go deep enough to ensure satisfactory progress
   - Don't micromanage every detail

### Adjust Monitoring Frequency by TRM

| TRM Level | Monitoring Frequency | Style |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Low | Frequent (daily or near-daily) | Close supervision |
| Medium/Growing | Moderate (weekly checks) | Transitioning |
| High | Minimal (periodic review) | Loose supervision |

1. **For Newly Delegated Tasks**:
   - Increase monitoring intensity initially
   - Focus on understanding approach, not just outcomes

2. **As Performance Improves**:
   - Decrease monitoring frequency
   - Shift to sampling approach
   - Allow more autonomy

3. **Warning Signs**:
   - If TRM drops (task changes, pace accelerates), increase monitoring
   - If problems emerge, revisit TRM assessment

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **"Let them pay tuition"**: Allowing subordinates to learn through customer-impacting mistakes
- **Insincere delegation**: Emotionally holding onto tasks while pretending to delegate
- **Meddling**: Prescribing specific activities instead of monitoring outcomes
- **One-size-fits-all**: Using the same supervision style regardless of TRM

## When to Use This Skill

- Assigning new tasks to subordinates
- Adjusting supervision levels as team members gain experience
- Onboarding new employees
- Delegating work you previously handled yourself
- Struggling with work-life balance due to excessive involvement
