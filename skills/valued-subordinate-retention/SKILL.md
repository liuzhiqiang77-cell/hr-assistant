# Valued Subordinate Retention

When a valued, dedicated subordinate resigns because they feel unappreciated, immediate and strategic action can often retain them. This procedure applies when the resignation is motivated by recognition and growth issues, not purely financial offers.

## When to Use This Skill
- A valued, dedicated, and loyal subordinate announces resignation
- The employee feels their work is unappreciated
- The resignation is NOT solely motivated by money or perks at another company
- The employee is considered "valued" and "dedicated" to the organization

**DO NOT use when**:
- The employee is purely motivated by better financial offers elsewhere
- The employee is not considered valued or dedicated
- The resignation is due to unavoidable circumstances (relocation, family issues)

## Phase 1: Immediate Reaction (The Opening Skirmish)

### Act Immediately
- Drop what you are doing right now
- This is a high-priority situation
- Delay reduces chances of successful retention

### Initial Conversation
1. **Sit the subordinate down immediately**
2. **Ask why they are quitting**
3. **Let them talk completely**
   - Do not argue
   - Do not lecture
   - Do not panic
4. **Allow them to deliver rehearsed points**, then:
   - Ask more questions to uncover real issues
   - Dig beneath the surface reasons
5. **Convey importance through actions**
   - Show they matter to you
   - Demonstrate genuine concern
6. **Do NOT try to change their mind yet**
   - Focus on buying time to prepare for the next round
   - Gather information before proposing solutions

## Phase 2: Supervisor Involvement

### Engage Your Supervisor
- Go to your supervisor for help and advice
- Make the resignation your supervisor's problem
- Ensure they participate in the solution
- Leverage additional resources and authority

## Phase 3: Corporate Citizenship & Solution Pursuit

### Pursue Every Avenue
- Vigorously explore all options to keep the employee with the firm
- Consider transferring to another department if necessary
- Become the project manager of the solution until settled

### The Golden Rule Principle
- You owe it to the employer to save an employee for the company
- Reciprocity among managers: help retain talent for the organization
- The goal is retaining the person, not necessarily in your specific role

## Phase 4: Presenting the Solution

### Develop a Real Solution
- Return with a solution that addresses the real reasons for leaving
- Ensure the solution also benefits the company
- Be creative and flexible

### Reframe the Situation
Alleviate fears of being viewed as a "blackmailer":

**Say**: "You did not blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways."

This reframing:
- Validates the employee's concerns
- Removes stigma from accepting the solution
- Frames the retention as organizational improvement

## Phase 5: Countering External Offers

### If They Have Accepted Another Job
- Make them "quit again" (renounce the other offer)
- Use the commitment argument:
  - They have made two commitments:
    1. One to a vague potential employer
    2. One to you and their current team
  - Commitments to daily colleagues are far stronger than those to a "casual new acquaintance"

### Emphasize Team Bonds
- Highlight relationships with current colleagues
- Remind them of the investment in the team
- Contrast the known with the unknown

## Key Principles

### Speed Matters
- Immediate response dramatically increases success rate
- Delay allows the employee to emotionally detach
- Quick action demonstrates genuine value

### Listen First, Solve Second
- Understand the real issues before proposing solutions
- Surface-level reasons often hide deeper problems
- The initial conversation is for information gathering, not persuasion

### Organizational Loyalty
- Retain talent for the company, not just your team
- Be willing to transfer if that's the best solution
- Act as a corporate citizen, not just a territorial manager

### Remove Stigma
- Frame the solution as organizational improvement
- Don't make the employee feel like they manipulated the situation
- Validate their concerns as legitimate feedback
