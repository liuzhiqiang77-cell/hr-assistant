description: Use this skill when delegating tasks to subordinates. It covers assessing Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM), establishing shared operational values, selecting appropriate tasks to delegate, and monitoring delegated work without meddling. Apply when you need to free up your time, develop subordinates, or ensure accountability for delegated work.

# Task-Relevant Maturity-Based Delegation

## When to Use
- You need to delegate tasks to free up time
- You want to develop subordinate capabilities
- You must ensure accountability for delegated work
- A subordinate is taking on new responsibilities
- You need to determine appropriate supervision levels

## Core Concepts

### Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)
TRM is NOT general maturity or competence. It is specific to the task at hand and combines:
- Achievement orientation (drive to achieve)
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience relevant to the specific task

A person can have high TRM in one job and low TRM in another. TRM can change day by day or hour by hour based on pace, environment, or task changes.

### Operational Values
Effective delegation requires a shared understanding of:
- How the organization works together
- Priorities within the organization
- The correct way to do things

Without shared operational values, you cannot effectively delegate because you remain accountable for subordinate output.

## Delegation Process

### Step 1: Establish Shared Operational Values
Before delegating:
1. Ensure commonality of operational values, priorities, and preferences
2. Teach the subordinate the correct operational values early
3. Prevent "customer tuition"—do not let subordinates learn through customer-impacting mistakes
4. Remember: The supervisor is accountable for teaching values, not the subordinate

### Step 2: Assess TRM
Evaluate the subordinate's TRM for the specific task:
- **Low TRM**: New to task, new environment, or accelerated pace
- **Medium/Growing TRM**: Gaining experience and confidence
- **High TRM**: Experienced veteran with the specific task

### Step 3: Select Tasks to Delegate
Follow these rules:
1. **Ensure common information base**: Delegator and delegatee must share context
2. **Delegate familiar tasks**: Choose tasks you know well (easier to monitor)
3. **Avoid insincere delegation**: Don't emotionally hold onto tasks while pretending to delegate
4. **Retain responsibility**: "Delegation without follow-through is abdication"

### Step 4: Monitor Based on TRM
Apply quality assurance principles:

**Timing Principle**: Monitor at the lowest-added-value stage
- Review rough drafts, not final polished versions
- Catch basic content problems early before expensive work

**Sampling Principle**: Do not check 100% of details
- Go into details randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress
- Avoid meddling (prescribing specific activities)

**Frequency Adjustment**: Vary based on TRM
- **Low TRM**: Monitor frequently and intensively
- **Growing TRM**: Decrease monitoring as work improves
- **High TRM**: Minimal monitoring, focus on results

## Key Principles

1. **Supervisor Accountability**: You are accountable for subordinate output, so you cannot delegate without shared values
2. **TRM Specificity**: Always assess TRM for the specific task, not general competence
3. **Internalization**: As TRM grows, structure moves from externally imposed to internally adopted
4. **Monitoring vs. Meddling**: Monitor progress and quality, but do not prescribe specific activities

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Letting subordinates "pay tuition" via customer-impacting mistakes
- Delegating without a common information base
- Holding onto tasks emotionally while pretending to delegate
- Monitoring 100% of details (meddling)
- Confusing general maturity with task-relevant maturity
