# TRM Assessment Examples

## Low TRM Scenarios
- A seasoned manager starting in a new department
- An engineer working with unfamiliar technology
- Any employee when job pace abruptly accelerates
- A person taking on responsibilities they've never handled before

## High TRM Scenarios
- An experienced veteran performing their regular duties
- Someone who has successfully completed similar tasks multiple times
- An employee who has internalized the operational values and processes

## TRM Changes
TRM can drop when:
- The work environment changes significantly
- Task content shifts unexpectedly
- The pace of work accelerates beyond previous experience
- New tools or methodologies are introduced

## Common Mistakes
- Assuming age or general experience equals high TRM
- Not reassessing TRM when tasks change
- Failing to recognize that TRM is task-specific, not person-specific
