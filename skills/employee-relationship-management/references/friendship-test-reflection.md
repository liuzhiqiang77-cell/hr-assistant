# Manager-Friendship Compatibility Test: Reflection Guide

## Before the Test

Reflect on your relationships:

- List subordinates you are considering befriending:
  1. 
  2. 
  3. 

- What draws you to each person?

- What concerns do you have about blurring boundaries?

## Applying the Test

For each person, close your eyes and imagine:

- Sitting across from them in a conference room
- They have missed a major deadline
- Their work has impacted the team's deliverables
- You need to deliver a performance improvement plan
- You need to document this formally for HR


**Physical/Emotional Reaction:**

| Person | Reaction (Cringe/Unaffected) | Decision |
|--------|------------------------------|----------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

## After the Test

**If you decided NOT to befriend:**
- How will you maintain a positive working relationship?
- What boundaries will you set?

**If you decided to befriend:**
- How will you ensure you can still deliver tough feedback?
- What signals will you give that work comes first?

## Ongoing Monitoring

Even after deciding, periodically check in with yourself:
- Am I hesitating to give necessary criticism?
- Am I treating this person differently than others?
- Can I still be objective about their performance?
