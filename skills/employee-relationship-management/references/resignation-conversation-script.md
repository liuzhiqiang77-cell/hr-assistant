# Resignation Conversation Script

## Opening (The "Sit Down")

**Manager:** "[Name], I've heard you're resigning. Can you sit down with me right now? I want to understand what's happening."

**Subordinate:** [explains reason]

**Manager:** "Tell me more about that. What specifically has made you feel this way?"

**Subordinate:** [delivers rehearsed points]

**Manager:** "I'm hearing you. Can you give me an example of when that happened?" [probe for underlying issues]

**Manager:** "I want to make sure I fully understand. Is there anything else?" [continue until exhausted]

**Manager:** "Thank you for being honest with me. This is important to me and to the company. I need some time to think about this, and I want to get some advice. Can we talk again tomorrow morning?"

## The Solution Meeting

**Manager:** "I've been thinking about our conversation, and I've spoken with [Supervisor]. We want to keep you with the company, and we think there's a solution."

[Present solution—could be promotion, transfer, new responsibilities, recognition program]

**Manager:** "You know, you didn't blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have been doing anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware that we needed to do better by you. We should have recognized this earlier."

## If They Have Another Offer

**Manager:** "I understand you have another offer. I want you to think about your commitments. On one hand, you have a commitment to a new employer you don't really know yet. On the other hand, you have commitments to [team members] who you work with every day. Which commitment feels stronger to you?"

**Manager:** "What would it take for you to 'quit again'—to walk away from that offer and stay with us?"
