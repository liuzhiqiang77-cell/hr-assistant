# Employee Relationship Management

Managing relationships with subordinates requires navigating personal boundaries while maintaining professional effectiveness. This skill covers two critical scenarios: deciding whether to befriend subordinates, and retaining valued employees who feel unappreciated.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Considering a friendship** with a subordinate and unsure if it's professionally appropriate
- **A valued subordinate announces resignation** and you suspect they feel unappreciated
- **Wanting to proactively address** dissatisfaction with high performers
- **Concerned about blurring personal/professional boundaries** with direct reports

## Manager-Friendship Compatibility Test

### The Core Decision

Everyone must decide for themselves what is professional and appropriate. This test provides a structured way to make that decision.

### Step 1: Visualize the Scenario

Imagine yourself delivering a **tough performance review** to the person you are considering befriending.

### Step 2: Assess Your Reaction

| Scenario | Reaction | Interpretation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Scenario A** | You cringe at the thought | Friendship will likely hinder professional duties |
| **Scenario B** | Your stomach remains unaffected | Personal relationships will likely strengthen work relationships |

### Step 3: Apply Decision Rule

**IF Scenario A (Cringe):**
- **Decision:** Do not make friends at work
- **Rationale:** The emotional connection will make it difficult to deliver necessary criticism, conduct performance reviews, or make tough personnel decisions

**IF Scenario B (Unaffected):**
- **Decision:** Proceed with friendship
- **Rationale:** You can maintain professional boundaries while enjoying a personal connection

### Key Insight

The test works because tough performance reviews are the litmus test for whether you can separate personal feelings from professional judgment.

## Retaining a Valued Subordinate Who Resigns

### When to Apply This Procedure

Apply when ALL these conditions are met:
1. Subordinate is **highly valued, dedicated, and loyal**
2. Subordinate **feels work is unappreciated** (this is the root cause)
3. Resignation is **NOT solely motivated** by money or perks at another company

**Do NOT apply if:**
- Employee is purely motivated by better financial offers elsewhere
- Employee is not considered "valued" or "dedicated"

### Phase 1: The Opening Skirmish (Immediate Reaction)

**Actions:**
1. **Drop what you are doing immediately**—this takes priority
2. **Sit the subordinate down** and ask why they are quitting
3. **Let them talk completely**—do not argue, lecture, or panic
4. **Allow rehearsed points** to be delivered, then ask more questions to uncover real issues
5. **Convey importance through actions**—show through your presence and attention that they matter

**Critical Goal:** Do NOT try to change their mind yet. Focus on **buying time** to prepare for the next round.

### Phase 2: Supervisor Involvement

**Actions:**
1. Go to **your supervisor** for help and advice
2. **Make the resignation your supervisor's problem** to ensure they participate in the solution

**Rationale:** You need organizational support and potentially resources (promotion, transfer, raise) that may require higher-level approval.

### Phase 3: Corporate Citizenship & Solution Pursuit

**Actions:**
1. **Vigorously pursue every avenue** to keep the employee with the firm
2. **Consider transfers** to another department if that's the best solution
3. **Become the project manager** of the solution until settled

**The Golden Rule (Reciprocity Among Managers):**
You owe it to the employer to save an employee for the company. This isn't about hoarding talent for your team—it's about retaining value for the organization.

### Phase 4: Presenting the Solution

**Actions:**
1. Return with a solution that addresses **real reasons** and benefits the company
2. **Reframe the situation** to alleviate fears of being viewed as a "blackmailer":

> "You did not blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways."

**Key Point:** Frame the solution as something the organization should have done anyway—not as a capitulation to a threat.

### Phase 5: Countering External Offers

If the subordinate has accepted another job:

**The "Quit Again" Strategy:**
1. Make them **"quit again"** (renounce the other offer)
2. **Argument:** They have made two commitments:
   - One to a vague potential employer
   - One to you/his current team
3. **Emphasize:** Commitments to daily colleagues are far stronger than those to a "casual new acquaintance"

### Desired Outcome

- Subordinate retains employment with the company (potentially in a new role/department)
- Subordinate successfully withdraws external resignation
- Relationship is strengthened by demonstrating their value

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence | Correct Approach |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| Ignoring gut feeling about friendship test | Professional conflicts, inability to deliver tough feedback | Trust the cringe test—if you cringe, don't befriend |
| Arguing during resignation announcement | Defensive reaction, employee shuts down | Listen first, argue later after preparing solution |
| Trying to solve alone | Limited resources, lack of organizational support | Involve your supervisor to access resources |
| Focusing only on keeping in YOUR team | May miss better organizational fit | Consider transfers—retain for the company, not just you |
| Letting employee feel like blackmailer | Guilt, damaged long-term relationship | Reframe as correcting an organizational error |
| Competing only on salary | Loses to deeper-pocketed competitors | Address appreciation, recognition, growth—not just money |

## Proactive Application: Prevention

Don't wait for a resignation to demonstrate appreciation. Regularly:
- Recognize contributions publicly and privately
- Discuss career aspirations and growth paths
- Check in on satisfaction levels
- Ensure compensation reflects value
- Provide challenging, meaningful work

This retention procedure is a **last-resort intervention**. The best approach is preventing the resignation in the first place.
