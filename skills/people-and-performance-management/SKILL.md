# People and Performance Management

## When to Use
- An employee is not performing their job duties
- Planning or conducting one-on-one meetings with direct reports
- Deciding whether to establish a friendship with a subordinate
- Managing a team with increased span of control

## Scenario 1: Employee Performance Diagnosis

### Trigger Condition
An employee is not performing their job duties

### Execution Steps

1. **Identify Underperformance**
   - Observe that the employee is not doing their job
   - Ensure role and expectations are clearly defined

2. **Determine Root Cause**
   Categorize the issue into one of two buckets:
   - **Can't do it**: The employee lacks the capability (Training issue)
   - **Won't do it**: The employee lacks the motivation (Motivation issue)

3. **Select Intervention**
   - If **Can't do**: Train the employee
   - If **Won't do**: Motivate the employee

4. **Constraint**
   - There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output other than motivate and train

## Scenario 2: Adapted One-on-One Meeting Protocol

### Trigger Conditions
- Electronic information sharing is available (email/networks)
- Span of control has increased (more direct reports)

### Execution Steps

1. **Assess Information Availability**
   - Recognize that employees are now more aware of business developments through computer networks
   - They do not rely solely on managers for basic updates

2. **Adjust Frequency**
   - Do not hold one-on-one meetings as often with a larger number of direct reports (e.g., 10) as with fewer (e.g., 5)
   - You do not need to meet as often as in the past

3. **Adjust Duration**
   - Conduct meetings of shorter duration compared to previous standards

4. **Refine Purpose**
   Retain meetings primarily for:
   - Mutual education
   - Exchange of information regarding specific problems, skills, and concerns
   - NOT for general status updates

5. **Define Roles**
   - **Supervisor Role**: Teach skills and know-how, suggest ways to approach things
   - **Subordinate Role**: Provide detailed information on specific work, problems, and concerns

6. **Validation**
   - Confirm that one-on-one meetings are still absolutely necessary
   - Their scope has narrowed to focus on education and specific issues

## Scenario 3: Manager-Friendship Compatibility Test

### Trigger Condition
Deciding whether to establish a friendship with a subordinate

### Execution Steps

1. **Visualization**
   - Imagine yourself delivering a tough performance review to the person you are considering befriending

2. **Assess Physical/Emotional Reaction**
   - **Scenario A**: You cringe at the thought
   - **Scenario B**: Your stomach remains unaffected

3. **Apply Decision Rule**
   - **IF Scenario A (Cringe)**: Do not make friends at work. The relationship will likely hinder professional duties.
   - **IF Scenario B (Unaffected)**: Proceed with friendship. Personal relationships will likely strengthen work relationships.

4. **Conclusion**
   - Everyone must decide for themselves what is professional and appropriate based on this test

## Key Variables

- **Performance_Root_Cause**: Either 'Capability' (Can't) or 'Motivation' (Won't)
- **direct_reports_count**: Number of employees reporting directly to the manager
- **electronic_info_saturation**: Whether the team is already well-informed via computer networks
- **Reaction_To_Review**: 'Cringe' or 'Unaffected'
