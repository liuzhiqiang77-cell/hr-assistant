# Materials Support Supervisor Performance Evaluation Example

This is a detailed example of applying performance evaluation principles to a specific management role transition (Finance to Manufacturing).

## Context
- **Role**: Materials Support Supervisor
- **Review Period**: 2/82 - 8/82
- **Career Transition**: Finance background to Manufacturing role

## Core Responsibilities
1. Managing the production planning process
2. Managing the manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

## Evaluation Framework

### Production Planning Performance

**What to Assess**:
- Significant process changes during review period
- Site coordination effectiveness
- Administrative activity efficiency

**Rating Criteria**:
- **Good**: Sites well coordinated, activities efficiently done

### Manufacturing Specifications Performance

**Goal Setting Assessment**:

*Negative Indicators*:
- Difficulty setting objectives and key results
- "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews (e.g., March review)
- Lack of definitive statement on system direction

*Consequence*: Falling into the trap of "working on" things without reaching objectives.

**Meeting Effectiveness Assessment**:

*Negative Indicator*: Satisfaction that "having a meeting on a subject" constitutes progress.

*Corrective Action*: Employee must define specific results to accomplish **prior** to each meeting.

### Strengths & Background Utilization

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Speed of learning (e.g., getting up to speed quickly to take over from predecessor)
- Utilization of prior background (e.g., finance) to assist other areas voluntarily

**Example**: Helping Purchasing group sort out finance problems demonstrates cross-functional value.

## Promotion Eligibility Assessment

### Current Status
- Promotion to next management level is **denied** if specific criteria are not met

### Required Capabilities for Promotion
Must be able to:
1. Take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system)
2. Show **results** on those projects

### Required Actions
1. Clear and concise breakdown of problems
2. Identification of goals
3. Establishment of the way to achieve those goals

### Independence Requirement
- Employee must be the **primary driver**
- Supervisor helps only when needed
- Promotion contingent on demonstrating capability for independent work

## Final Rating Determination

### Rating: "Meets Requirements"

Assigned if:
- Capable of doing current job
- Acknowledging specific areas need improvement (goal setting, defining ways of accomplishing tasks)

### Context Adjustment
- Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance

## Required Signatories
1. Immediate Supervisor
2. Approving Supervisor
3. Matrix Manager
4. Personnel Administrator
5. Employee
