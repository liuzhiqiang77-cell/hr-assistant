# Peter Principle Examples

## Example 1: Top Salesperson Promoted to Sales Manager

**Current Role**: Excellent salesperson, consistently top performer
**Target Role**: Sales manager requiring coaching, team leadership, strategic planning

**Risk**: Sales skills ≠ management skills
**Outcome without mitigation**: Sales manager fails, team performance suffers

**Mitigation**: Assess management competencies before promotion; provide management training

## Example 2: Star Engineer Promoted to Engineering Manager

**Current Role**: Brilliant technical problem-solver
**Target Role**: Manager requiring people management, project coordination, communication

**Risk**: Technical brilliance ≠ leadership ability
**Outcome without mitigation**: Engineer frustrated in management role, team demoralized

**Mitigation**: Dual career track; allow technical advancement without management

## Example 3: Successful Teacher Promoted to Principal

**Current Role**: Excellent classroom teacher, loved by students
**Target Role**: Principal requiring administration, budgeting, staff management

**Risk**: Teaching skills ≠ administrative leadership
**Outcome without mitigation**: Principal struggles, school management suffers

**Mitigation**: Assess administrative competencies; provide leadership development
