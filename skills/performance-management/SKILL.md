# Performance Management

## When to Use This Skill
- An employee is not performing their job duties effectively
- Making promotion or hiring decisions
- Designing promotion and selection systems
- Diagnosing root causes of performance problems
- Planning employee development interventions

## Part 1: Employee Performance Diagnosis

### Core Framework
When an employee is not performing, the root cause is always one of two categories:

```
Performance Issue → Can't do it (Capability) OR Won't do it (Motivation)
```

### Diagnosis Steps

1. **Identify Performance Gap**
   - Observe that employee is not meeting expectations
   - Document specific performance deficiencies

2. **Determine Root Cause**
   - **Can't do it**: Employee lacks capability, skill, or knowledge
   - **Won't do it**: Employee lacks motivation, willingness, or engagement

3. **Select Intervention**
   - If **Can't do**: Provide training, coaching, skill development
   - If **Won't do**: Provide motivation, incentives, accountability

4. **Apply Constraint**
   - There is nothing else a manager can do to improve output
   - All performance interventions must address either capability or motivation

### Execution Guidelines
- Ensure role and expectations are clearly defined before diagnosing
- Gather objective performance data
- Consider both skill gaps and motivational factors
- Match intervention to root cause (training for capability, motivation for willingness)

## Part 2: The Peter Principle

### Core Concept
"In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

### Mechanism
1. **Selection Criteria**: Candidate selected based on performance in current role
2. **Missing Criteria**: Selection occurs "rather than on abilities related to the intended role"
3. **Trajectory**: Employee promoted until reaching a role they are not skilled for
4. **Outcome**: Employee stops being promoted once no longer competent

### When It Applies
- Hierarchical promotion structure exists
- Selection decisions based on past performance data
- Skills required for new role differ from current role

### When It Does NOT Apply
- Selection based on competencies specific to intended role
- Skills required for new role are identical to current role
- Promotion system includes competency assessment for target role

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Competency-Based Promotion**
   - Assess candidates against skills required for target role
   - Don't assume current role success predicts target role success

2. **Role-Specific Evaluation**
   - Define competencies for each level independently
   - Evaluate against target role requirements, not current performance

3. **Trial Periods**
   - Test candidates in target role before permanent promotion
   - Assess fit for new responsibilities

4. **Dual Career Tracks**
   - Provide advancement opportunities without requiring management roles
   - Allow individual contributors to progress without role changes that don't match their skills

## Execution Steps

### For Performance Diagnosis
1. Document specific performance gaps
2. Assess employee's capability (skills, knowledge, resources)
3. Assess employee's motivation (engagement, incentives, attitude)
4. Categorize as "can't" or "won't"
5. Implement appropriate intervention (training or motivation)
6. Monitor results and adjust approach

### For Promotion Decisions
1. Define competencies required for target role
2. Evaluate candidate against target role competencies
3. Don't rely solely on current role performance
4. Consider trial periods or acting assignments
5. Assess fit between candidate skills and new responsibilities
6. Provide development support if gaps identified

## Constraints
- Performance diagnosis assumes role and expectations are clearly defined
- Peter Principle assumes hierarchical structure and performance-based selection
- Both frameworks require objective assessment and documentation
