# Strategic Career Management

## When to Use
- Managing personal career in a competitive global environment
- Facing career stagnation or organizational changes
- When business operations incur major losses due to competition
- Deciding whether to pivot focus to core strengths

## Part 1: Personal Career Management

### Sole Proprietor Mindset

Adopt this fundamental perspective:
- You are not an employee; you are a business with one employee: yourself
- You compete with millions of similar businesses globally
- **Nobody owes you a career**; you own it as a sole proprietor

### Daily Career Management Actions

1. **Retain competitive advantage** - Continually dedicate yourself to this
2. **Enhance value** - Improve it every day
3. **Hone competitive advantage** - Keep it sharp
4. **Learn and adapt** - Constantly
5. **Be mobile** - Willing to move from job to job, industry to industry
6. **Retrench if necessary** - Start again when needed

### The Three Self-Assessment Questions

**Question 1: Value Addition**
- Ask: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"
- Principle: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization"
- Standard: Every hour should increase output or value of people you're responsible for

**Question 2: Connectivity**
- Ask: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?"
- Status: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people"

**Question 3: Innovation**
- Ask: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"
- Action: Personally try new things; don't just read about them

### Addressing Internal Threats

**Threat:** Ambitious junior employees desiring upward movement in slow/no-growth environments

**Your Responsibility:** Avoid being "in the way" - move up or move on

## Part 2: Organizational Strategic Pivot

### When to Apply Pivot Logic
Trigger conditions:
- Market share declining due to superior/cheaper competition
- Current business operations incurring major losses

### Strategic Pivot Process

1. **Assess Competitive Threat** - Identify if competitors perfected technology and manufacturing prowess
2. **Evaluate Financial Viability** - Determine if price competition forced prices to loss-incurring levels
3. **Apply "Lead with Strength" Heuristic** - Accept that "being second best in a tough environment is just not good enough"
4. **Execute Strategic Exit** - Back out of business that's no longer the strength
5. **Focus Resources** - Shift entirely to business where company is "best at"
6. **Implement Operational Changes** - Move employees, let some go, shutter factories
7. **Contextualize** - Understand this is one wave of globalization
