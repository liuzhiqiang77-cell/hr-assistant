# Maslow Need Level Definitions

## Physiological Needs
- **Definition:** Basic necessities of life (food, clothing, shelter) that money can buy
- **Driver:** Fear of deprivation (e.g., fear of starvation)
- **Example:** Workers in Dickensian England working to avoid starvation
- **Characteristics:** Once a specific monetary target is met, motivation from this need ceases

## Safety/Security Needs
- **Definition:** Desire to protect oneself from slipping back to deprivation
- **Driver:** Protection against catastrophic loss
- **Example:** Medical insurance protecting against bankruptcy from hospital fees
- **Characteristics:** Rarely dominant in modern workplace, but absence badly affects performance

## Social/Affiliation Needs
- **Definition:** Inherent desire to belong to a group with common traits
- **Key Insight:** "Misery loves not just any company, but the company of other miserable people" - like seeks like
- **Driver:** Companionship and team identity
- **Example:** An employee accepting a low-paying job solely for the companionship of colleagues
- **Characteristics:** Drives team cohesion and social bonding

## Esteem/Recognition Needs
- **Definition:** Desire to keep up with or emulate a specific person or group ("keeping up with the Joneses")
- **Driver:** Recognition from a specific reference group
- **Key Constraint:** Esteem exists in the eyes of the beholder
  - Example: An athlete greeting a top player feels great to the athlete, but means nothing to their family
- **Limitation:** Self-limiting. Once a goal is reached (e.g., becoming VP), the need loses urgency and stops motivating

## Self-Actualization Needs
- **Definition:** Need to achieve one's "utter personal best" in a chosen field
- **Key Distinction:** Unlike other motivation sources, it does NOT extinguish after needs are fulfilled; drives performance to ever higher levels
- **Driver Types:**
  - **Competence-Driven:** Focus on job or task mastery; sharpening own skill (e.g., violinist practicing daily)
  - **Achievement-Driven:** Abstract need to achieve in all endeavors; testing the "boundary of capability" (e.g., teenager perfecting skateboard trick)
- **Behavioral Classification:**
  - *Gamblers:* High risk, no influence on outcome
  - *Conservatives:* Very little risk
  - *Achievers:* Challenge themselves at the boundary of capability to test limits
- **Commonality:** Both types spontaneously try to test the outer limits of their abilities
