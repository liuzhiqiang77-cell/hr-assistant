# Maslow Need Motivation Analysis

## When to Use This Skill

Apply this framework when:
- A manager needs to understand why an employee is behaving a certain way
- Analyzing reactions to raises, promotions, or compensation changes
- Diagnosing motivation problems in teams or individuals
- Determining what incentives will be effective

## Core Principles

### The Causal Chain
Needs cause drives, which result in motivation. Only unsatisfied needs motivate.

### The Satiation Rule
A need once satisfied stops being a source of motivation. To maintain high motivation, keep some needs unsatisfied at all times.

### Dominance Principle
- People have multiple concurrent needs, but one need is always dominant
- The dominant need determines behavior and performance level
- When a lower need is satisfied, a higher need typically takes over

### Regressive Movement (Edge Case)
Drastic environmental changes (e.g., crisis, disaster) can cause instant regression from high-level needs to basic survival needs.

## Diagnostic Method: Money Motivation Test

Use this test when observing an employee's reaction to a salary increase or compensation change:

### Step 1: Observe the Reaction Focus
- **Scenario A:** Employee focuses on the **absolute sum** of money received
- **Scenario B:** Employee focuses on **relative comparison** against others (ranking, fairness)

### Step 2: Determine Motivation Mode

| Reaction Focus | Motivation Mode | How Money is Viewed | Implications |
|---|---|---|---|
| Absolute Sum | Physiological or Safety | Utilitarian resource to buy necessities | Motivation ceases when monetary target is met |
| Relative Comparison | Esteem, Recognition, or Self-Actualization | Measure of achievement / Scorecard | Motivation is boundless; 'second ten million' matters as much as first |

### Step 3: Apply the Insight
- **Lower levels:** Money satisfies a deficit need (filling a gap)
- **Upper levels:** Money satisfies a growth need (signifying achievement)

## Need Level Classification

See `references/maslow-need-definitions.md` for detailed definitions of each level:

1. **Physiological** - Basic necessities (food, shelter)
2. **Safety/Security** - Protection from deprivation/catastrophe
3. **Social/Affiliation** - Belonging to a group
4. **Esteem/Recognition** - Keeping up with a reference group
5. **Self-Actualization** - Achieving personal best (does not extinguish)

## Workflow for Analysis

1. **Identify the behavior** you want to understand
2. **Consider the context** - life situation, environmental factors
3. **Apply diagnostic tests** (e.g., money test if compensation involved)
4. **Map to need level** using detailed definitions
5. **Determine dominant need** - what is currently unsatisfied?
6. **Consider hierarchy position** - are lower needs met, enabling higher needs to dominate?

## Important Constraints

- Needs are not strictly isolated; concurrent needs exist
- Interpretation is subjective (e.g., "esteem exists in the eyes of the beholder")
- Cultural differences may affect what constitutes an "expected level" for each need
- Self-actualization is unique: it does NOT extinguish when fulfilled
