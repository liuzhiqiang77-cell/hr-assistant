# Strategic Pivot Case Study: Intel's Exit from DRAMs

## Background
- **Company:** Intel Corporation
- **Time Period:** Mid-1980s
- **Original Business:** DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) chips
- **Challenge:** Japanese manufacturers perfected DRAM technology and manufacturing

## The Situation

### Competitive Threat
- Japanese companies offered higher quality at lower prices
- Intel's DRAM technology was no longer superior
- Market share rapidly eroding

### Financial Impact
- Price competition forced prices below profitable levels
- DRAM business incurring "major losses"
- Core business becoming financial burden

### Internal Dynamics
- Intel was founded on DRAMs—emotional attachment
- DRAMs represented company identity and history
- Difficult to consider abandoning founding product

## The Decision Process

### Assessment Phase
1. Recognized Japanese manufacturing prowess
2. Accepted that Intel was no longer #1 in DRAMs
3. Identified microprocessors as area where Intel was "best at"
4. Applied "Lead with Strength" heuristic

### Strategic Decision
- "Being second best in a tough environment is just not good enough"
- Decision: Exit DRAM business entirely
- Pivot: Focus 100% on microprocessors

## Execution

### Operational Changes
- **Employee Impact:**
  - Moved and redeployed many employees
  - Let some employees go
  - Retrained others for microprocessor work

- **Asset Impact:**
  - Shuttered a number of DRAM factories
  - Repurposed manufacturing capacity
  - Wrote off DRAM-related assets

### Leadership Challenges
- Communicating difficult decision to employees
- Managing morale during transition
- Maintaining confidence in company direction
- Overcoming emotional attachment to DRAMs

## The Outcome

### Short-term Pain
- Significant financial write-offs
- Employee layoffs and reassignments
- Market uncertainty about Intel's future

### Long-term Gain
- Intel became dominant microprocessor company
- "Intel Inside" became global brand
- Enabled personal computer revolution
- Company value increased exponentially

## Key Lessons

1. **Emotion vs. Strategy:** Founding identity can blind strategic vision
2. **Speed Matters:** Delaying exit increases losses
3. **Core Competency:** Success comes from leveraging true strengths
4. **Globalization:** This was "one wave of a much larger tide"
5. **Decisiveness:** Partial commitment to pivot fails; full commitment required

## Applicability to Other Situations

### When to Consider Strategic Pivot
- Market share declining to superior competitors
- Financial losses becoming structural
- Core competency exists elsewhere
- Industry dynamics shifting permanently

### Warning Signs
- Denial about competitive position
- Emotional attachment to legacy business
- Hope that market will "come back"
- Incremental responses to fundamental threats

### Success Factors
- Honest assessment of competitive position
- Clear identification of true strengths
- Willingness to make painful decisions
- Sufficient resources to fund transition
- Leadership alignment on new direction
