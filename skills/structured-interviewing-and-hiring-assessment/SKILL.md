# Structured Interviewing and Hiring Assessment

## When to Use
- Conducting an interview session with job candidates
- Planning interview strategy and approach
- Checking references for potential hires
- Conducting follow-up interviews after reference checks
- Making final hiring decisions

## Core Principles

### Maintain Honesty
- Do not use tricks or gimmicks to test character
- Be completely straightforward about yourself and the environment
- Show the company as it really is
- Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired

### Define the Ultimate Purpose
- Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance
- Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit

## Interview Preparation

### Gather Prerequisites
- Scheduled interview time
- Candidate resume and background information
- List of references (for later phase)

### Plan Your Approach
- Define what you need to assess: technical skills, problem-solving capacity, operational values
- Prepare hypothetical scenarios relevant to the job
- Review the candidate's background to identify areas to probe

## Conducting the Interview

### Ask Specific Recommended Questions

Assess the candidate using these key questions:

- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

### Categorize Your Inquiries

Ensure comprehensive coverage across these categories:

- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, technical capabilities, weaknesses
- **What They Did With Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures, application of learning
- **Discrepancies**: Learning from failures, problems in current position, prevention strategies
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new job, why the company should hire them

### Utilize Direct Questions

- Ask blunt questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?")
- Elicit direct answers rather than rehearsed responses
- Observe the candidate's reaction and confidence/timidity
- Gauge actual capability through response quality and demeanor

### Employ Hypothetical Situations

- Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps)
- Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result
- Observe their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly
- Assess how they think under pressure

### Invite Candidate Questions

- Ask the candidate what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job
- Analyze their questions to determine:
  - What they already know about the role
  - What they value in a position
  - How prepared they are for the interview

## Reference Checking Protocol

### Goal
- Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly
- Verify and validate candidate responses

### Build Rapport

**If you know the reference personally:**
- You have a better chance of getting "real" information
- Leverage the existing relationship

**If the reference is a stranger:**
- Keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association
- Use the connection to increase openness

### Timing Matters
- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes
- Allow time for rapport to develop before asking sensitive questions

## Follow-Up Interviews

- If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from reference checks
- Clarify any discrepancies or concerns that emerged
- Make final assessments before decision

## Acknowledge Limitations

- Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- Accept that it merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well
- Understand there is always a risk of failure
- No hiring process can eliminate all uncertainty
