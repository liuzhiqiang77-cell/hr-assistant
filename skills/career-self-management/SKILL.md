# Career Self-Management

## When to Use
- You are employed or seeking employment
- Navigating career decisions and transitions
- Planning professional development
- Assessing career progress and direction
- Preparing for organizational changes or industry shifts

## Core Mindset: Sole Proprietor

You are not an employee; you are a business with one employee: yourself.

**Key implications:**
- You are in competition with millions of similar businesses globally
- Fellow workers are not primary rivals; they are outnumbered (ratios of 1000:1, 100,000:1, or 1,000,000:1) by people working for competing organizations
- "Nobody owes you a career"; you own it as a sole proprietor

## Daily Career Management Actions

### Continuous Value Enhancement
- Dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competitive advantage
- Enhance your value every day
- Hone your competitive advantage
- Learn and adapt constantly

### Strategic Mobility
- Be willing to move from job to job
- Be willing to move from industry to industry if necessary
- Retrench if necessary to start again
- Manage your career to avoid becoming a casualty of globalization and the information revolution

## Address Internal Threats

### Slow/No-Growth Environments
- **Threat**: Ambitious junior employees desire upward movement but are blocked by your position
- **Boss's dilemma**: Choosing between retaining you (doing a good job but blocking others) or promoting the junior
- **Your responsibility**: Avoid being "in the way" (move up or move on)

## Self-Assessment Protocol: The 3 Questions

### Question 1: Value Addition
**Ask**: "Are you adding real value or merely passing information along?"

**Action**: Continually look for ways to make things truly better in your department

**Principle**: "The output of a manager is the output of his organization"

**Standard**: Every hour of the day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people you are responsible for

### Question 2: Connectivity
**Ask**: "Are you plugged into what's happening around you?" (Includes inside the company and the industry)

**Check**: Do not wait for a supervisor to interpret events

**Status**: Be a "node connected to a network of plugged-in people" rather than "floating by yourself"

### Question 3: Innovation
**Ask**: "Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies personally?"

**Action**: Personally try new things; do not just read about them

**Warning**: Do not wait for others to figure out how to re-engineer your workplace—and you out of that workplace

## Apply Productivity Principles

- Apply methods of production to your work
- Exercise managerial leverage in your role
- Elicit an athlete's desire for peak performance
- Treat your career as a business to be optimized

## Key Variables

- **Competitive_Landscape**: Global market of individuals capable of doing your work
- **Internal_Threat_Level**: Presence of ambitious junior employees in slow/no-growth environments
- **Manager_Output**: The output of the organization unit for which the manager is responsible

## Strategic Context

### Globalization Impact
- Work can go anywhere on earth
- You compete globally, not just locally
- Continuous adaptation is required
- Geographic location no longer guarantees employment security

### Information Revolution Impact
- Information hiding places are disappearing
- Continuous learning is essential
- Technology skills must be constantly updated
- Knowledge obsolescence accelerates

## Outcome

A proactive career management strategy focused on:
- Continuous value addition
- Adaptability and learning
- Competitive advantage retention
- Strategic mobility
- Long-term employability in a dynamic global economy
