# Training Program Implementation

## When to Use
- When you decide to implement a training program for subordinates
- When preparing to teach for the first time
- When you want to leverage your domain knowledge to develop others

## Phase 1: Preparation and Mindset

### Manage Expectations (First-Time Instructors)

**Acknowledge the Difficulty**
- Teaching is "hard work" involving lecture preparation and handling unpredictable questions
- Expect to discover knowledge gaps even with long-term job experience
- **Key Principle**: "Much deeper knowledge of a task is required to teach that task than simply to do it"
- **Analogy**: Consider the difficulty of explaining to someone over the phone how to drive a stick-shift car

**Recognize the Personal Benefit**
- The instructor is the primary beneficiary: "Guess who will have learned most from the course? You."
- Course development provides "crispness" to your understanding of your own work
- This improved understanding makes the effort "extremely worthwhile"

**Leverage Emotional Rewards**
- A successful training process is "nothing short of exhilarating"
- Seeing a subordinate practice the taught material creates a "warm feeling" that "dwarfs" the exhilaration
- "Relish the exhilaration and warmth" to build resilience for future courses

## Phase 2: Needs Assessment

### Identify Training Needs
- Create a list of topics subordinates should be trained in
- Do not limit the scope; include:
  - Simple tasks (e.g., taking calls)
  - Broad concepts (e.g., objectives, value systems)
- Ask subordinates what they feel they need to uncover unknown needs

### Resource Inventory and Prioritization
- Take inventory of available manager-teachers and instructional materials
- Assign priorities to the items on the training list

## Phase 3: Course Design and Launch

### Initial Course Design
- Start unambitiously with one short course (three to four lectures)
- Focus on the most urgent subject
- Be aware that explaining skills is harder than practicing them
- Avoid excessive background information that obscures the course objective

### Preparation and Launch
- Set a schedule with deadlines to prevent getting bogged down
- Create an outline for the whole course
- Develop **only the first lecture** and begin teaching

## Phase 4: Iterative Development

### The Throwaway Principle
- Regard the first delivery as a 'throwaway'; accept it will be unsatisfactory
- Develop the second lecture only after delivering the first

### Pilot Strategy
- To mitigate damage and improve the course, teach the first version to knowledgeable subordinates
- Knowledgeable participants can provide interaction and critique without confusion
- Expect to discover "how much you don't know"—this is typical

## Phase 5: Scalability

### Scalability Assessment
- Determine if you can teach all members personally
- If many repetitions are needed (e.g., ten or twenty courses), use train-the-trainer model
- Train a few instructors using the first set of lectures

## Phase 6: Feedback and Evaluation

### Collect Feedback
- After the course, request anonymous critiques from employees
- Use a form prompting for:
  - Numerical ratings
  - Open-ended questions

### Interpret Feedback
- Expect mixed feedback (too detailed, too superficial, just right in equal balance)
- Aim to satisfy yourself that objectives are met
- Do not try to please everyone

## Constraints
- First iteration of training will be unsatisfactory (accept this)
- Requires availability of knowledgeable subordinates for initial pilot
- Requires time commitment from manager-instructor
