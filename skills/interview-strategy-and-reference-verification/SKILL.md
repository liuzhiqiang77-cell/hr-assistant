# Interview Strategy and Reference Verification

Use this skill for the strategic aspects of hiring, including pre-interview planning, reference verification, and understanding the limitations of the hiring process.

## When to Use
- When planning your overall interviewing strategy
- When checking candidate references
- When conducting follow-up interviews
- When performing post-interview analysis and decision-making

## Core Strategic Principles

### 1. Define the Ultimate Purpose

The goal of interviewing and reference checking is to:
- Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance
- Assess fit by understanding how the candidate performed in their previous employer's environment
- Bridge between the candidate's past and your organization's future

### 2. Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks

**Do NOT use tricks:**
- Avoid gimmicks like the "three-legged chair" test
- Don't create artificial situations to test character

**Be completely straightforward:**
- Show yourself and the environment as they really are
- Provide accurate information about the role and organization
- Rationale: A candidate is a potential employee. Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired.

## Reference Checking Protocol

### Goal
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly, but from an external source.

### Rapport Building

**If you know the reference personally:**
- You have a better chance of getting "real" information
- Leverage the existing relationship to encourage openness

**If the reference is a stranger:**
- Keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association
- Build rapport gradually through conversation

### Timing Strategy
- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes
- Allocate sufficient time for the reference check (minimum 30 minutes recommended)
- Don't rush to the questions—build the relationship first

### Follow-Up Interviews

If possible, conduct a second interview with the applicant after checking references:
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from reference checks
- Clarify any discrepancies between candidate claims and reference feedback
- Give the candidate an opportunity to explain or elaborate on information from references

## Acknowledge Limitations

Recognize the inherent constraints of the hiring process:
- Careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- No method can perfectly predict future performance
- Accept that interviewing merely increases the odds of making a good hiring decision
- Maintain realistic expectations about the success probability

## Output

The final hiring decision should be based on:
- Comprehensive assessment of candidate qualifications
- Verified information from references
- Strategic understanding of fit for the role and organization
- Acknowledgment of the inherent risks and uncertainties
