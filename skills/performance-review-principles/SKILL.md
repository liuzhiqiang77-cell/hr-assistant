# Performance Review Core Principles

Apply these foundational principles when conducting performance reviews to ensure fair and effective assessment.

## When to Use
- Conducting a performance review for any subordinate
- Designing or evaluating a performance review system
- Reviewing manager performance relative to organization results

## Principle 1: Fundamental Purpose of Performance Reviews

### Primary Goal
**Improve the subordinate's performance**

### Focus Areas
1. **Skill Level**
   - Determine what skills are missing
   - Find ways to remedy the lack of skills

2. **Motivation**
   - Intensify the subordinate's motivation
   - Aim to move the subordinate to a "higher performance curve" for the same skill level

### Secondary Purposes
Acknowledge these as valid but prioritize performance improvement:
- Assessing work
- Motivating employees
- Providing feedback
- Justifying raises
- Rewarding performance
- Discipline
- Direction setting
- Reinforcing culture

## Principle 2: Time Offset and Long-Term Assessment

### Analyze Time Offset
- Determine if output in the review period is linked to activities in the same period
- Recognize that current output may be the "light from distant stars" (reflecting work done years ago)

### Judge Performance Based on Activities
- **IF tangible output is absent but activities were strong** (e.g., setting up a facility from scratch): Give credit for performance
- **Do NOT penalize** a subordinate for lack of immediate output if they are building future capacity

### Weigh Long-term vs Short-term
- Evaluate immediate outputs (e.g., meeting schedule) against future-oriented activities (e.g., improving design methods)

### Apply Present Value Concept
- Estimate how much the future-oriented activity will pay back over time
- Determine what that future value is worth today to decide its current significance

## Principle 3: The Potential Trap Rule

### Core Rule
**The performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the rating accorded to his organization.**

### Assess Substance Over Form
- **DO**: Evaluate actual performance and real output
- **DO NOT**: Consider "potential" defined as form (knowledge, handling oneself well, looking like a manager)

### Enforce Consequences for Poor Organizational Performance
- If the business unit lost money, missed revenue forecasts, slipped schedules, or showed poor internal measures → the manager **cannot** receive a high rating
- **Reject** excuses that the organization failed but the manager is "outstanding"

### Prevent Negative Signaling
- Avoid signaling that "acting" like a manager is sufficient
- Reinforce that **performing** like a manager is the requirement

## Combined Application
When conducting reviews:
1. Start with the fundamental purpose (improve performance)
2. Apply time offset analysis to give fair credit for long-term work
3. Apply the potential trap rule to ensure manager ratings reflect organizational reality
