# Potential Trap Scenarios

## Scenario 1: The "High Potential" Manager

**Situation**: A manager is considered "high potential" based on:
- MBA from top school
- Excellent presentation skills
- Strong industry knowledge
- Great relationships with peers

**Problem**: The division lost money for 2 consecutive years.

**Trap**: Rating the manager "Exceeds Requirements" because of "potential" while the organization performs poorly.

**Correct Application**:
- Organization Rating: Does Not Meet Requirements
- Manager Rating: Does Not Meet Requirements (maximum allowed)
- Feedback: "Your potential is evident, but your organization's performance is unacceptable. A manager's output is the output of their organization."

## Scenario 2: External Factors Defense

**Situation**: Manager argues: "My organization performed poorly because of market conditions, supply chain issues, and competitor actions beyond my control."

**Trap**: Accepting this excuse and rating the manager higher than the organization.

**Correct Application**:
- Organization Rating: Poor
- Manager Rating: Poor
- Response: "Part of your job as a manager is to anticipate and mitigate external factors. Your organization's performance reflects your effectiveness."

## Scenario 3: The Turnaround Situation

**Situation**: New manager took over a failing organization. Performance is still poor, but significant progress made.

**Nuanced Application**:
- Organization Rating: Poor (actual results)
- Manager Rating: Can be higher than organization IF you can demonstrate:
  - Clear trajectory of improvement
  - Specific actions taken
  - Measurable progress against baseline
- **But**: Rating cannot be "Outstanding" if organization is "Poor"

**Guideline**: The gap between manager and organization ratings should be justified by exceptional evidence of turnaround progress.
