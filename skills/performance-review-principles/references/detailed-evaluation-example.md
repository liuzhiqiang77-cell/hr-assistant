# Materials Support Supervisor Evaluation Example

This example demonstrates how to apply performance review principles in a specific management role context.

## Core Responsibilities Assessment
- Responsible for managing the production planning process
- Responsible for managing the manufacturing specifications process (including maintenance and development)

## Evaluation Framework

### Production Planning Performance
- Check for significant process changes during the review period
- Verify site coordination and administrative activity efficiency
- **Rating: 'good'** if sites are well coordinated and activities are efficiently done

### Manufacturing Specifications Performance

**Goal Setting Assessment**
- Determine if the employee defines "clear, concise, and specific goals"
- **Negative Indicators**:
  - Difficulty setting objectives and key results
  - "Mushy" conclusions to system reviews (e.g., March review)
  - Lack of definitive statement on system direction
- **Consequence**: Falling into the trap of "working on" things without reaching objectives

**Meeting Effectiveness Assessment**
- Determine if the employee confuses holding meetings with actual progress
- **Negative Indicator**: Satisfaction that having a meeting on a subject constitutes progress
- **Corrective Action**: Employee must define specific results to accomplish **prior** to each meeting

### Strengths & Background Utilization
- Evaluate speed of learning (e.g., getting up to speed quickly to take over from predecessor)
- Evaluate utilization of prior background (e.g., finance) to assist other areas voluntarily

## Promotion Eligibility Criteria

**Current Status**: Promotion to next management level is denied if specific criteria are not met, regardless of desire.

**Required Capabilities**
- Must be able to take complex projects (e.g., manufacturing spec system) and show results

**Required Actions**
- Clear and concise breakdown of problems
- Identification of goals
- Establishment of the way to achieve those goals

**Independence Requirement**
- Employee must be the "primary driver"; supervisor helps only when needed
- Promotion is contingent on demonstrating capability for independent work

## Final Rating Determination

**Meets Requirements**: Assigned if capable of doing current job, but acknowledging specific areas (goal setting, defining ways of accomplishing tasks) need improvement.

**Context Adjustment**: Consider environmental transition difficulties (e.g., finance to manufacturing) when interpreting performance.
