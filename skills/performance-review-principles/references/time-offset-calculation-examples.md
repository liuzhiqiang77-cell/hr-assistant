# Time Offset Calculation Examples

## Example 1: R&D Project Lead

### Situation
- Engineer spent entire year setting up new testing facility
- No products shipped during review period
- Traditional metrics would show "zero output"

### Time Offset Analysis
- **Activities**: Strong - facility design, equipment procurement, team hiring
- **Output**: None visible yet
- **Time Offset**: 18-24 months (facility will enable future products)
- **Present Value**: High - facility will accelerate all future R&D

### Performance Rating
- **Traditional approach**: Poor (no output)
- **Time offset approach**: Excellent (building critical future capacity)

## Example 2: Sales Manager

### Situation
- Sales manager restructured territory assignments
- Q1-Q2 sales declined during transition
- Q3-Q4 sales accelerated significantly

### Time Offset Analysis
- **Activities**: Strong - territory analysis, reassignment, team training
- **Output**: Mixed (short-term decline, long-term gain)
- **Time Offset**: 6 months
- **Present Value**: Positive - new structure will yield 15% higher annual revenue

### Performance Rating
- **Traditional approach**: Mixed (decline in Q1-Q2)
- **Time offset approach**: Excellent (strategic improvement with temporary dip)

## Example 3: Process Improvement Engineer

### Situation
- Engineer redesigned manufacturing process
- Production slowed during implementation
- Quality improved by 30% after implementation

### Time Offset Analysis
- **Activities**: Strong - process analysis, redesign, implementation
- **Output**: Delayed - quality gains appeared after review period
- **Time Offset**: 3 months
- **Present Value**: High - 30% quality improvement = significant cost savings

### Performance Rating
- **Traditional approach**: Fair (production slowdown)
- **Time offset approach**: Excellent (strategic quality improvement)
