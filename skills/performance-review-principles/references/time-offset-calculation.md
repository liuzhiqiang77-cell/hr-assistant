# Time Offset and Present Value Calculations

## Example 1: R&D Project Lead

**Situation**: An R&D manager spent the entire year setting up a new research facility. No products shipped.

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Current output: Zero (no products shipped)
- Activities: High (facility setup, team hiring, process design)
- Future value: Expected $50M in new products over 5 years

**Present Value Calculation**:
- If future value = $50M over 5 years
- Assuming 10% discount rate, present value ≈ $31M
- This represents significant current-year contribution

**Rating Adjustment**: Give high credit for building future capacity.

## Example 2: Process Improvement Engineer

**Situation**: Engineer spent 6 months redesigning a manufacturing process. Production dipped during transition.

**Time Offset Analysis**:
- Current output: Reduced (production dip)
- Activities: High (process redesign, training, implementation)
- Future value: 20% efficiency improvement = $2M/year savings

**Present Value Calculation**:
- Annual savings = $2M
- 5-year total = $10M
- Present value (10% discount) ≈ $6.3M
- One-time transition cost = $500K
- Net present value = $5.8M

**Rating Adjustment**: Credit for the net present value created, not penalize for temporary dip.

## Example 3: Sales Manager - Potential Trap

**Situation**: Sales manager's team missed revenue target by 30%. Manager is charismatic, well-dressed, and "looks like a leader."

**Organization Rating**: Poor (missed target by 30%)

**Potential Trap Analysis**:
- Form: High (looks like a manager, confident, knowledgeable)
- Substance: Low (actual results poor)

**Application of Rule**:
- Manager Rating CANNOT exceed Organization Rating
- Maximum rating: Poor
- **Reject**: "Outstanding" rating based on "potential"

**Correct Action**: Rate as Poor, focus on improving actual team performance.
