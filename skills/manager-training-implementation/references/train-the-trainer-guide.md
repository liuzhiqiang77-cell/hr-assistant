# Train-the-Trainer Model

## When to Use
- Organization is large (many employees need training)
- Manager cannot personally deliver all sessions
- Training needs to be sustainable long-term

## Selection Criteria for Trainers

Choose potential instructors who:
1. Have demonstrated competence in the subject matter
2. Show interest in teaching others
3. Have good communication skills
4. Are respected by their peers
5. Have the time availability to commit to training

## Training the Trainers Process

### Step 1: Attend the Course
Potential instructors first attend the course as participants.

### Step 2: Review Materials
Provide instructors with:
- Detailed instructor notes
- Slide decks or visual aids
- Exercise instructions and answer keys
- Common participant questions and suggested answers

### Step 3: Practice Teaching
Each instructor practices teaching:
- One module or section
- In front of a small audience
- With feedback from the master instructor

### Step 4: Co-Teaching
New instructors co-teach with an experienced instructor:
- Handles one portion of the course
- Has backup support available
- Gains confidence before teaching solo

### Step 5: Solo Teaching with Observation
First solo delivery is observed by master instructor:
- Provides real-time coaching if needed
- Debriefs after the session
- Identifies areas for improvement

### Step 6: Independent Delivery
Instructor delivers courses independently:
- Periodic refreshers may be scheduled
- Feedback from participants is shared
- Community of practice among instructors
