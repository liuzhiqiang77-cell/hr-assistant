# Analyzing Feedback Results

## Common Patterns

**"Too detailed" + "Too superficial" feedback**:
- This indicates different experience levels among participants
- Solution: Offer optional deep-dive sessions for advanced learners

**Low ratings on "Pace of the course"**:
- If rating is low AND "Amount of material" is low → too slow
- If rating is low AND "Amount of material" is high → too fast
- Solution: Adjust based on which direction

**Low ratings on "Clarity of explanations"**:
- Often indicates instructor's knowledge gaps
- Solution: Prepare more examples, simplify explanations

**High ratings on "Instructor's knowledge" but low on "Teaching effectiveness"**:
- Instructor knows the material but struggles to explain it
- Solution: Practice with a small group first, use more examples

## What to Focus On

**Don't fix**:
- One-off complaints that are outliers
- Requests for completely different topics (wrong course)
- Complaints about things you can't control (room temperature, time of day)

**Do fix**:
- Patterns in feedback (same comment from multiple people)
- Areas where low ratings appear across multiple items
- Confusion that affects learning objectives

**Improvement Iteration**:
- Address top 2-3 issues before next delivery
- Don't try to fix everything at once
- Track improvements over time
