# Manager Training Implementation and First-Time Teaching

Use this skill when you are a manager implementing a training program for subordinates, especially if you are teaching for the first time.

## When to Use

- You are a manager who wants to train subordinates
- You have been assigned to teach or train others
- You are preparing to teach for the first time
- You need to scale training across a large organization
- You want to improve your own understanding of your work

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Plan and Prepare

1. **Identify Training Needs**
   - Create a list of topics subordinates should be trained in
   - Do not limit the scope—include simple tasks (e.g., taking calls) and broad concepts (e.g., objectives, value systems)
   - Ask subordinates what they feel they need to uncover unknown needs

2. **Resource Inventory and Prioritization**
   - Take inventory of available manager-teachers and instructional materials
   - Assign priorities to the items on the training list

3. **Initial Course Design**
   - Start unambitiously with one short course (three to four lectures) on the most urgent subject
   - Be aware that explaining skills you possess is harder than practicing them
   - Avoid the temptation to provide excessive background information that obscures the course objective

4. **Preparation and Launch**
   - Set a schedule with deadlines to prevent getting bogged down
   - Create an outline for the whole course
   - Develop only the first lecture and begin teaching

### Phase 2: Deliver and Iterate

5. **Iterative Development**
   - Develop the second lecture only after delivering the first
   - Regard the first delivery as a "throwaway"—accept it will be unsatisfactory
   - To mitigate damage and improve the course, teach the first version to knowledgeable subordinates who can provide interaction and critique without confusion

6. **Expect Knowledge Discovery**
   - Teaching is hard work—prepare for lecture preparation and unpredictable questions
   - Expect to discover knowledge gaps: Even with long-term job experience, you will realize "how much you don't know"
   - **Key Principle**: Much deeper knowledge of a task is required to teach that task than simply to do it
   - Analogy: Consider the difficulty of explaining to someone over the phone how to drive a stick-shift car
   - Do not be discouraged by this discovery—it is typical

### Phase 3: Scale and Evaluate

7. **Scalability Assessment**
   - Determine if you can teach all members personally or if it requires many repetitions (e.g., ten or twenty courses)
   - If the organization is large, use the first set of lectures to train a few instructors (train-the-trainer model)

8. **Feedback and Evaluation**
   - After the course, request anonymous critiques from employees
   - Use a form prompting for numerical ratings and open-ended questions
   - Expect mixed feedback (too detailed, too superficial, just right in equal balance)
   - Aim to satisfy yourself that objectives are met, rather than trying to please everyone

### Phase 4: Recognize Benefits

9. **Leverage Personal Learning**
   - **Primary Beneficiary**: The instructor (Guess who will have learned most from the course? You)
   - The course development process provides "crispness" to your understanding of your own work
   - This improved understanding makes the effort "extremely worthwhile" in itself

10. **Leverage Emotional Rewards**
    - **Immediate Reward**: A successful training process is "nothing short of exhilarating"
    - **Ultimate Reward**: Seeing a subordinate practice the taught material creates a "warm feeling" that "dwarfs" the exhilaration
    - Relish the exhilaration and warmth to build resilience for tackling the second course

## Variables

- `training_list`: List of identified training topics ranging from simple to complex
- `course_length`: Recommended initial duration of 3-4 lectures
- `feedback_form`: Tool for collecting numerical ratings and open-ended comments
- `instructor_experience`: Length of time the instructor has performed the job they are teaching
- `training_success`: Whether the training process is perceived as going well

## Prerequisites

- Manager desires to train subordinates
- Access to department members for needs assessment
- Assignment to teach or train others
- Possession of subject matter expertise

## Constraints

- The first iteration of training will be unsatisfactory
- Requires availability of knowledgeable subordinates for initial pilot
- Explaining skills is harder than practicing them
