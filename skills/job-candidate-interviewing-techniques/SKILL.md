# Job Candidate Interviewing Techniques

## When to Use
- When you have a scheduled interview with a job candidate
- When you need to assess a candidate's technical skills, problem-solving ability, values, and readiness for the role
- When you have the candidate's resume and background information available

## Interview Questioning Framework

### 1. Ask Recommended Assessment Questions
Pose specific questions to evaluate different dimensions:
- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

### 2. Categorize Inquiries for Coverage
Ensure you assess all key areas:
- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, technical capabilities, weaknesses
- **Application of Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures, lessons learned
- **Discrepancies**: Problem-solving approaches, prevention strategies
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new role, alignment with company needs

### 3. Use Direct Questions to Gauge Confidence
Ask blunt, direct questions such as "How good are you technically?" and observe:
- The candidate's immediate reaction
- Their confidence or timidity in responding
- Whether the answer matches their demeanor

### 4. Employ Hypothetical Situations
Walk the candidate through a specific process or problem relevant to the job:
- Describe a real work scenario (e.g., manufacturing steps)
- Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result
- Assess their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly

### 5. Invite Candidate Questions
Ask the candidate what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job. Analyze their questions to determine:
- What they already know about the role/company
- What they value in a position
- How prepared and thoughtful they are

## Assessment Output
The interview should yield an evaluation of:
- Candidate's technical skills and knowledge application
- Problem-solving approach and capacity
- Operational values and alignment with the role
- Potential fit within the organization
