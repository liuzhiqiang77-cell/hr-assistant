# Interviewing and Hiring

## Recommended Interview Questions

Ask specific questions to assess the candidate:

- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

## Question Categories

Ensure coverage across these categories:

1. **Technical/Skills**: Projects, weaknesses
2. **What He Did With Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures
3. **Discrepancies**: Learning from failures, problems in current position
4. **Operational Values**: Readiness for new job, why the company should hire them

## Interviewing Techniques

### Direct Questions
Ask blunt questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?") to elicit direct answers. Observe the candidate's reaction and the confidence/timidity of the response to gauge actual capability.

### Hypothetical Situations
Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps). Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result to discover their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly.

### Candidate Questions
Ask the candidate what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job. Analyze their questions to determine what they already know, what they value, and how prepared they are.

## Reference Checking

### Goal
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.

### Rapport Building
- If you know the reference personally, you have a better chance of getting "real" information
- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

### Timing
The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond.

### Follow-up Interviews
If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references. Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks.

## Strategic Principles

### Ultimate Purpose
Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance. Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit.

### Honesty and Avoid Tricks
- Do not use "tricks" (e.g., three-legged chair) to test character
- Be completely straightforward; show yourself and the environment as they really are
- A candidate is a potential employee. Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired.

### Acknowledge Limitations
Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success. It merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well.
