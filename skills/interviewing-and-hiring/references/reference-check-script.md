# Reference Check Script

## Opening

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm calling to speak with you about [Candidate Name], who has listed you as a reference. Do you have about 30 minutes to chat?"

## Rapport Building (First 5-10 minutes)

### Find Common Ground
- "How long have you known [Candidate]?"
- "What was your working relationship like?"
- "I see you both worked at [Company] - were you there at the same time?"

## Core Questions (Middle 10-15 minutes)

### Performance
- "What were [Candidate]'s primary responsibilities?"
- "How would you rate their overall performance?"
- "What were their biggest strengths?"
- "What areas needed improvement?"

### Specific Examples
- "Can you give me an example of a project where [Candidate] excelled?"
- "Tell me about a time [Candidate] faced a challenge. How did they handle it?"

### Values and Fit
- "How did [Candidate] handle feedback?"
- "What was [Candidate]'s working style like?"
- "Would you hire [Candidate] again? Why or why not?"

## Closing (Last 5-10 minutes)

### The "Real" Questions (After Rapport is Established)
- "Be honest with me - what's your biggest concern about [Candidate]?"
- "Is there anything else I should know?"
- "If you were in my position, would you hire [Candidate]?"

## Tips for Success

1. **Take Your Time**: Don't rush the rapport building. The last 10 minutes are gold.
2. **Listen More Than You Talk**: Let the reference speak. Silence is your friend.
3. **Note Tone and Hesitation**: What they don't say is as important as what they do.
4. **Ask for Specifics**: "Can you give me an example?" reveals more than general statements.
