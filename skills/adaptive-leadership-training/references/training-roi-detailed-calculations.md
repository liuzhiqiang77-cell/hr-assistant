# Detailed Training ROI Calculations

## Base ROI Formula

```
ROI = (Total Hours Gained / Manager Investment Hours) - 1
```

Where:
- Total Hours Gained = Total Student Hours × Performance Improvement %
- Manager Investment Hours = Course Hours × Prep Ratio

## Example Calculations

### Scenario 1: Small Team Training
- Students: 5
- Course: 2 hours
- Prep ratio: 3:1
- Manager time: 6 hours
- Annual student work: 10,000 hours (2,000 × 5)
- Improvement: 2%

**Calculation:**
```
Hours Gained = 10,000 × 0.02 = 200 hours
Manager Time = 2 × 3 = 6 hours
ROI = (200 / 6) - 1 = 32.33x
```

### Scenario 2: Large Team Training
- Students: 20
- Course: 8 hours (multi-day)
- Prep ratio: 3:1
- Manager time: 24 hours
- Annual student work: 40,000 hours (2,000 × 20)
- Improvement: 1%

**Calculation:**
```
Hours Gained = 40,000 × 0.01 = 400 hours
Manager Time = 8 × 3 = 24 hours
ROI = (400 / 24) - 1 = 15.67x
```

### Scenario 3: Critical Skills Training
- Students: 10
- Course: 40 hours (extensive technical training)
- Prep ratio: 2:1 (less for established material)
- Manager time: 80 hours
- Annual student work: 20,000 hours
- Improvement: 5% (high-impact training)

**Calculation:**
```
Hours Gained = 20,000 × 0.05 = 1,000 hours
Manager Time = 40 × 2 = 80 hours
ROI = (1,000 / 80) - 1 = 11.5x
```

## Cost Analysis Framework

### Direct Costs
- Student time (opportunity cost)
- Manager preparation time
- Materials and facilities

### Indirect Costs
- Disruption to operations
- Manager's attention diverted from other tasks

### Cost-Benefit Decision Matrix

| Improvement Required | Training Investment | Decision |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------|
| <1% improvement | High (>$500k equivalent) | Likely not justified |
| 1-3% improvement | Moderate ($100-500k equivalent) | Justify based on strategic importance |
| >3% improvement | Any reasonable investment | Typically justified |
| Critical safety/quality | Any necessary investment | Mandatory |

## Training Load Examples

### Growing Organization
- Turnover: 15%
- Growth: 20%
- Task 1 Load: 35%
- Task 2 Magnitude: 100% / 35% = 2.86x

### Stable Organization
- Turnover: 5%
- Growth: 0%
- Task 1 Load: 5%
- Task 2 Magnitude: 100% / 5% = 20x

**Insight**: Task 2 (new skills training) is disproportionately expensive in stable organizations with low turnover.
