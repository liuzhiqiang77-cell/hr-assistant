# Task-Relevant Maturity Examples

## Key Concept

Task-Relevant Maturity is **NOT** about overall experience or age. It is about the employee's maturity **for a specific task**.

### Examples of Varying Maturity by Task

#### Example 1: Senior Engineer, New Technology
- **Overall**: 15 years experience, highly mature engineer
- **Task**: Implementing new AI framework
- **Maturity for this task**: **Immature**
- **Management style**: Hands-on training
- **Reason**: Despite seniority, they are learning this specific task

#### Example 2: Junior Developer, Routine Maintenance
- **Overall**: 6 months experience, junior
- **Task**: Fixing common bugs in established codebase
- **Maturity for this task**: **Mature**
- **Management style**: Delegate approach
- **Reason**: They have demonstrated competence in this specific area

#### Example 3: Marketing Manager, New Product Launch
- **Overall**: 10 years experience, mature
- **Task**: Launching product in completely new market segment
- **Maturity for this task**: **Immature**
- **Management style**: Hands-on training
- **Reason**: No prior experience with this market segment

#### Example 4: Sales Rep, Routine Territory
- **Overall**: 2 years experience
- **Task**: Selling to established customer base
- **Maturity for this task**: **Mature**
- **Management style**: Delegate approach
- **Reason**: Consistent performance with these customers

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Using Overall Maturity for Task Decisions
**Wrong**: "She's been here 10 years, let her handle it"
**Right**: "Has she done this specific type of project before?"

### Error 2: Failing to Reassess
**Wrong**: Assuming maturity from previous task carries to new task
**Right**: Explicitly assess maturity for each new task type

### Error 3: One-Style Management
**Wrong**: Always hands-on (micromanagement) or always hands-off (neglect)
**Right**: Adjust based on task-relevant maturity for each assignment

## Assessment Questions

To determine task-relevant maturity, ask:

1. Has this person performed this specific type of work before?
2. Have they performed it successfully without supervision?
3. Can they handle unexpected problems in this task area?
4. Do they understand the context and dependencies of this task?

**If NO to any question**: Consider immature for this task
**If YES to all questions**: Likely mature for this task
