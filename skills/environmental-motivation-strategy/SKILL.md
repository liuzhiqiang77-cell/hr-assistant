# Environmental Motivation Strategy

## When to Use
- Managing knowledge workers where output is difficult to measure
- Implementing Management by Objectives (MBO) systems
- Creating organizational culture to drive peak performance
- Managing high-potential employees seeking self-actualization
- Transitioning from manual labor management to knowledge worker management

## Core Principle
**Motivation must come from within the individual.** A manager cannot force motivation directly but can only create an environment in which motivated people flourish.

## Success Definition
**Better motivation equals better performance, NOT a change of attitude or feeling.**
- Attitude is merely an indicator ("window into the black box")
- Desired result is better performance at a given skill level
- A subordinate saying "I feel motivated" means nothing without performance improvement

## Strategy Selection

### Manual Labor Context
- **Output**: Readily measurable
- **Historical Approach**: Fear of punishment (loss of life/food) worked well
- **Limitation**: Not applicable to modern knowledge work

### Knowledge Worker Context
- **Output**: Difficult to measure immediately
- **Expectations**: Hard to state precisely
- **Requirement**: Humanistic approaches needed
- **Key Insight**: "Fear won't work as well with computer architects as with galley slaves"

## Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Self-Actualization Drivers
Determine if the employee is driven by:
- **Competence-Driven**: Job/task mastery, sharpening skills, beating personal best
- **Achievement-Driven**: Testing limits of capability, working at "boundary of capability"

### Step 2: Implement MBO Goal Setting
Set objectives at optimal difficulty:
- **Target Success Probability**: 50% ("fifty-fifty chance")
- **Rationale**: Output is greater when striving beyond immediate grasp, even with 50% failure rate
- **Objective**: Achieve peak performance from self and subordinates

### Step 3: Design Output-Centered Culture
Create an environment that values and emphasizes output:

**Avoid**: Knowledge-centered cultures
- Abstract knowledge valued over producing results
- Low actual achievement
- "Knowing" without "doing"

**Adopt**: Output-centered values
- Tangible results highly valued and esteemed
- Abstract knowledge without application gets little recognition
- Performance is the primary metric

## Constraints
- Assumes basic physiological and safety needs are met (Maslow's hierarchy)
- Not applicable for routine tasks requiring no creativity or stretch
- Requires manager to accept they cannot directly control motivation
