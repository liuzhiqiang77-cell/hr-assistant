# Management by Objectives (MBO) Implementation Guide

## Core Concept
Set objectives at a difficulty level where the individual has only a 50% chance of success, even with maximum effort.

## Why 50% Success Rate?
- Output tends to be greater when striving beyond immediate grasp
- Even with 50% failure rate, overall performance increases
- Prevents complacency from easy goals
- Prevents demotivation from impossible goals

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Clear Objectives**
   - Specific, measurable outcomes
   - Time-bound
   - Aligned with organizational goals

2. **Assess Current Capability**
   - Evaluate individual's current skill level
   - Determine realistic stretch targets
   - Calibrate difficulty to achieve ~50% success probability

3. **Set the Goal**
   - Present as challenging but achievable
   - Emphasize that failure is acceptable if effort was maximum
   - Focus on the stretch, not just the result

4. **Monitor Progress**
   - Regular check-ins
   - Adjust support, not the goal
   - Provide resources to help achieve stretch

5. **Evaluate Outcomes**
   - Assess both success and learning from failure
   - Recognize effort and growth
   - Use results to calibrate future goals

## Common Pitfalls
- Setting goals too easy (100% success = no growth)
- Setting goals too hard (0% success = demotivation)
- Changing goals mid-period (undermines commitment)
- Focusing only on results, not effort

## Cultural Requirements
- Psychological safety to attempt difficult goals
- Acceptance of failure as learning
- Focus on growth mindset
- Output-centered values
