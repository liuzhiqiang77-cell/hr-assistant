name: performance-review-for-specific-situations
description: Apply specialized performance review processes for poor performers requiring turnaround (the 'Blast' process to move through resistance stages) and high achievers needing continued development (moving beyond retrospective assessment to future improvement). Use when dealing with employees at either extreme of the performance spectrum or when standard review approaches are insufficient.

# Performance Review for Specific Situations

## When to Use This Skill
- Subordinate has a major performance problem requiring turnaround to avoid firing
- Subordinate is a high achiever who needs continued development guidance
- Standard review approaches are not producing results
- Employee is stuck in denial or blame regarding performance issues

## The 'Blast' Process for Poor Performers

### Identify the Resistance Stage

Track the subordinate's current stage:

1. **Ignore**: Passive ignoring of the problem
2. **Deny**: Active denial of the problem's existence
3. **Blame Others**: Admits problem exists but blames others to avoid responsibility
4. **Assume Responsibility**: Admits "It is my problem" (emotional step)
5. **Find Solution**: Intellectual step to remedy the situation

### Facilitate Progression Through Stages

1. **Ignore → Deny**: Use facts and examples to demonstrate reality
2. **Deny → Blame Others**: Use evidence to overcome resistance
3. **Blame Others → Assume Responsibility**: Guide the subordinate to take the "biggest step"—this is an emotional step where they realize "If it is my problem, I have to do something about it"
4. **Assume Responsibility → Find Solution**: Once responsibility is assumed, finding the solution is a shared intellectual task

### Possible Outcomes

- **Outcome 1**: Subordinate accepts assessment and recommended cure
- **Outcome 2**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment but accepts cure
- **Outcome 3**: Subordinate disagrees with assessment and does not commit

### Fallback Procedure (If Stuck at 'Blame Others')

1. Assume the formal role of supervisor with position power
2. State clearly: "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do."
3. Acknowledge disagreement: "I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right."
4. Assert organizational requirement: "I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do."
5. Secure the subordinate's commitment to the course of action
6. Monitor performance against that commitment

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### Identify the Problem

High achievers often receive reviews that are:
- Purely retrospective assessments (analyzing what they did in the prior year)
- Focused on justifying a high rating
- Lacking future-oriented guidance

### Contrast with Poor Performers

- Poor performers receive detailed "corrective action programs" (step-by-step affairs to meet minimum requirements)
- High achievers often lack specific guidance for continued improvement

### Shift the Priority

1. **Analyze current review content**: Is it retrospective or developmental?
2. **Define specific actions**: Identify what the subordinate needs to do to improve or maintain performance
3. **Recognize leverage**: High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work; improving them is a high-leverage activity

### Expected Output

A performance review that includes specific steps for future improvement, not just past justification.
