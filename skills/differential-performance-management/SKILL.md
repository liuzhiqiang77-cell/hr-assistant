# Differential Performance Management

## When to Use
- Deciding between hands-on or hands-off management for a specific task
- Managing employees at different maturity or performance levels
- Conducting reviews for high achievers vs poor performers
- Determining appropriate developmental focus

## Task-Relevant Maturity Management Style

### Assessment
Evaluate the employee's maturity level **specifically for the task at hand** (not general ability).

### Management Style Selection

**IF employee is immature in the task**:
- **Action**: Apply hands-on training
- **Critical Constraint**: Do NOT allow employee to "make their own mistakes" to learn
- **Reasoning**: The subordinate's tuition is paid by customers, which is wrong

**IF employee is more mature in the task**:
- **Action**: Apply delegate approach (hands-off management)
- **Reasoning**: Employee has demonstrated capability for independent work

### Manager Quality Indicator
This decision-making process distinguishes the top 5% of managers who think deeply about their craft from the 95% who do not.

## High Achiever Development Strategy

### The Common Pitfall
Supervisors often:
- Spend effort justifying the judgment of superior performance
- Give little attention to how the subordinate could do even better
- Focus on retrospective assessment (what they did last year)

### Contrast with Poor Performers
Poor performers often receive:
- Detailed "corrective action programs"
- Step-by-step affairs to meet minimum requirements

High achievers often receive:
- Justification of high rating
- Little future-oriented guidance

### High Achiever Development Approach
1. **Analyze current review content** - Is it retrospective or developmental?
2. **Identify gap** - Is there specific guidance for improvement?
3. **Define specific actions** the subordinate needs to take to:
   - Improve performance
   - Maintain current level
4. **Prioritize development** - Shift focus from past justification to future growth

### Rationale
High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work. Improving them is a **high-leverage activity** with great impact on group output.

## Execution Steps

### For Management Style Selection:
1. Assess employee's task-relevant maturity level
2. Select hands-on training for immature employees
3. Select delegate approach for mature employees
4. Enforce constraint: No "learn by mistakes" for immature tasks

### For High Achiever Reviews:
1. Identify subordinate as high performer
2. Check if review is purely retrospective assessment
3. Look for future-oriented improvement guidance
4. Define specific actions for continued growth
5. Recognize high-leverage impact of high achiever development

### Combined Approach:
1. Evaluate both maturity level and performance rating
2. Select appropriate management style based on maturity
3. Tailor review focus based on performance level:
   - Poor performers: Corrective action programs
   - High achievers: Future development strategies
4. Ensure both groups receive actionable guidance
