# The Peter Principle Context

## Definition

"In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

— Laurence J. Peter, 1969

## How It Relates to This Skill

The Promotion Performance Cycle explains the mechanism behind the Peter Principle:

1. Employees are promoted when they "exceed requirements"
2. After promotion, they start at "meets requirements" in the new role
3. If they improve to "exceed requirements," they get promoted again
4. Eventually, they reach a role where they only "meet requirements" and never exceed
5. This is their "level of incompetence"—or more accurately, their "level of competence"

## The Recycling Solution

The Peter Principle suggests that once someone reaches their level of incompetence, they stay there. This skill offers an alternative:

**Recycling allows employees to return to a role where they can excel, then attempt promotion again later with better preparation.**

## Key Difference

| Peter Principle View | This Skill's View |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| One-way street up | Mobility in both directions |
| Stuck at incompetence | Return to competence |
 | Termination when failing | Recycling and rebuilding |
| Permanent placement | Temporary setback, future growth |

## Strategic Value

By embracing recycling, organizations:
- Retain valuable institutional knowledge
- Maintain employee morale and loyalty
- Create a culture where it's safe to fail and recover
- Develop more resilient leaders who understand multiple levels of the organization
