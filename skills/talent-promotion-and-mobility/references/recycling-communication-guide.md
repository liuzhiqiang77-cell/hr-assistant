# Recycling Communication Guide

## Opening the Conversation

"I want to discuss your current role and how we can better position you for success."

## Acknowledging Management Responsibility

"Looking back, I realize we moved you into this role before you were fully ready. That's on me—I misjudged the timing."

## Framing the Move

"We've seen your strengths in [previous role], and we believe that's where you can make the biggest impact right now."

## Addressing the Future

"This isn't the end of your growth path. Once you're back to performing at your best, we'll revisit opportunities for advancement."

## Supporting Through Embarrassment

"I know this might feel like a step back, but many successful leaders have taken similar steps in their careers. What matters is that we find the right fit for your strengths."

## Team Communication (Optional)

If being transparent with the team:

"[Employee name] is moving back to [previous role] where their skills are most needed. We appreciate their willingness to do what's best for the team."

## What NOT to Say

- ❌ "You couldn't handle the job"
- ❌ "This is a demotion because of poor performance"
- ❌ "Maybe you're not cut out for management"
- ❌ "We're doing this for your own good" (patronizing)

## What TO Say

- ✅ "We want you in a position where you can excel"
- ✅ "Your strengths are better aligned with [previous role]"
- ✅ "I take responsibility for the timing of your previous promotion"
- ✅ "We value your contributions and want you to succeed"
