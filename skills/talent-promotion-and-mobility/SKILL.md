# Talent Promotion and Mobility

## When to Use
- Employee performance rating is "exceeds requirements"
- Evaluating whether to promote an employee
- A promoted employee performs below-average for an extended period
- An employee has been promoted "over their head"

## The Promotion Performance Cycle

### Phase 1: Initial State
- Employee starts at Job 1 performing at an "average" level
- "Average" is defined as "meets the requirements"

### Phase 2: Improvement Phase
- As time passes, the employee receives training and motivation
- Performance improves to "above-average" level
- "Above-average" is defined as "exceeds the requirements"

### Phase 3: Promotion Trigger
- Once the employee "exceeds the requirements," they are considered "promotable"
- Promote the employee to Job 2

### Phase 4: Performance Reset
- Upon entering Job 2, the employee initially performs only at "meets requirements" level
- This is normal due to new challenges and learning curve

### Phase 5: Cycle Repetition
- With experience in Job 2, the employee again improves to "exceeds requirements"
- This leads to another promotion

### Phase 6: Cycle Conclusion
- The cycle repeats until the employee settles at "meets requirements" level
- Employee is no longer promoted
- This is the employee's "level of competence"

## Critical Constraint: The Atrophy Risk

**If an employee "exceeds the requirements" but is NOT promoted to greater challenges, they will "atrophy" and performance will permanently return to "meets requirements."**

This is why timely promotion is critical for high performers.

## Employee Recycling Procedure

Use this when a promoted employee performs below-average for too long.

### Step 1: Identification
- Recognize that a person has been promoted into a position "so much over his head" that they perform below-average for an extended time

### Step 2: Solution Selection
- Choose to "recycle" the employee rather than terminate them

### Step 3: Definition of Recycling
- Put the employee back into the job they did well before the promotion

### Step 4: Management Accountability
- Management must admit it was "at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness" for more responsibility
- This is a management failure, not an employee failure

### Step 5: Implementation
- Take "forthright and deliberate steps" to place the person in a job they can do

### Step 6: Support System
- Support the employee in the face of likely "embarrassment"
- Acknowledge the difficulty of the situation

### Step 7: Transparency
- Execute the recycling "openly" to reduce stigma
- Do not hide or disguise the demotion

### Step 8: Expected Outcome
- The embarrassment will be "short-lived"
- The employee will regain confidence

### Step 9: Future Value
- Once confidence is regained, the employee becomes an "excellent candidate for another promotion" at a later time
- They are likely to succeed in future promotions

## Prohibited Action

**Do NOT force the employee to leave the company.**

Reject the rationalization that "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake."

## Key Principles

1. **Promotion is a cycle, not a destination**—performance resets after each promotion
2. **Timely promotion prevents atrophy**—high performers need new challenges
3. **Recycling is better than termination**—retain talent and rebuild confidence
4. **Management accountability is essential**—admit when promotion was a mistake
5. **Transparency reduces stigma**—open communication about recycling

## Constraints

- Does not apply to "noncompetitors" who have no motivation to do more
- Societal stigma regarding demotion must be actively managed
- Management tendency to view recycling as personal failure must be overcome
