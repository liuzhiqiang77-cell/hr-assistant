# Performance Diagnosis and Management

## When to Use This Skill
- An employee, subordinate, or team member is not performing their job effectively
- You need to determine whether a performance issue stems from capability or motivation
- You must decide whether to use hands-on training or a delegate approach for a specific task
- Assessing management style based on employee skill level relative to a task

## Diagnosing Performance Failure (Can't vs. Won't)

### Step 1: Apply the 'Life or Death' Mental Test
Ask yourself: **"If the person's life depended on doing the work, could he do it?"**

### Step 2: Determine Root Cause
- **YES answer**: The person is capable but NOT motivated → They **won't do it** (Motivation issue)
- **NO answer**: The person is NOT capable → They **can't do it** (Capability issue)

### Step 3: Select Managerial Intervention
| Root Cause | Intervention |
|------------|-------------|
| Can't do it (Capability) | Training |
| Won't do it (Motivation) | Motivation strategies |

**Critical Principle**: These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job. All other interventions are useless unless individuals try to offer their best.

## Task-Relevant Maturity Management Style

### Step 1: Assess Employee Maturity for the Specific Task
Evaluate the employee's skill level specifically for the task at hand—not overall capability.

### Step 2: Choose Management Style
| Employee Maturity | Management Style | Action |
|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Immature | Hands-on training | Apply direct training and supervision |
| More mature | Delegate approach | Apply hands-off management |

### Critical Constraint for Immature Employees
**Do NOT allow immature employees to 'make their own mistakes' to learn.**

**Rationale**: "The problem with this is that the subordinate's tuition is paid by his customers. And that is absolutely wrong."

## Key Differentiator
This diagnostic approach distinguishes the top 5% of managers who think deeply about their craft from the 95% who do not.

## Constraints
- Does not apply if the root cause is external to the individual (e.g., equipment failure)
- Never use 'learn by mistakes' for immature employees
