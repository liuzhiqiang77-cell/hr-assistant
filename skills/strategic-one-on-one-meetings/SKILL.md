# Strategic Leverage of One-on-One Meetings

## When to Use
- A supervisor schedules a recurring one-on-one meeting with a subordinate
- You need to establish a common base of information and working methods
- You want to enable efficient delegation
- You need to understand specific details and data from your subordinate's area

## Prerequisites
- Regular scheduled meeting time (e.g., every two weeks)
- Hierarchical reporting relationship
- Willingness to share information openly
- Time investment from supervisor

## Execution Steps

### 1. Calculate Leverage Potential
Recognize that a small time investment (e.g., 1.5 hours) can enhance work quality for a significant duration (e.g., two weeks or 80+ hours) and upgrade your understanding of the subordinate's tasks.

### 2. Establish Common Base
Use the meeting to develop a "common base of information" and "similar ways of doing and handling things" between supervisor and subordinate. This shared base is essential for efficient delegation.

### 3. Facilitate Reverse Teaching
Allow the subordinate to teach you specific details and data that you may only be vaguely familiar with. This information is absolutely essential for making good decisions.

### 4. Joint Data Analysis
Review specific indicators together (e.g., trend indicators of incoming orders). Ponder the data and consider their relationship to other industry indicators to distinguish between:
- Temporary anomalies (e.g., seasonal slowness)
- Actual business trends (e.g., business stopped growing)

### 5. Formulate Congruent Conclusions
Develop a "congruent attitude, approach, and conclusion" based on shared analysis.

**Example**: Deciding to take a "conservative approach to near-term investment" rather than assuming growth.

### 6. Execute Cascading Actions
- **Subordinate**: Implements decisions in their specific area of responsibility (e.g., scale back growth)
- **Supervisor**: Shares conclusions with other business groups or managers, multiplying the leverage across the organization

## Key Variables
- `meeting_duration`: Length of the one-on-one session (e.g., 1.5 hours)
- `impact_duration`: Period of enhanced work quality (e.g., two weeks)
- `information_base`: Shared understanding and context between supervisor and subordinate

## Expected Outcome
Aligned strategic decisions, scaled operational plans, and cascaded leverage affecting other business units.
