# Performance Diagnosis

Diagnose whether a performance issue stems from capability or motivation, and select the appropriate management intervention based on the employee's task-relevant maturity.

## When to Use
- Employee is not doing their job or performing poorly
- Deciding between hands-on training vs hands-off delegation
- Determining whether training or motivation strategies are needed
- Assessing appropriate management style for a specific task

## Diagnosis: Can't vs Won't

Apply the "Life or Death" Mental Test to identify the root cause:

1. **Identify the performance issue**: The person is not doing their job effectively.

2. **Ask the diagnostic question**: "If the person's life depended on doing the work, could they do it?"

3. **Determine the root cause**:
   - **Answer is YES** → Person is capable but NOT motivated → They "won't do it"
   - **Answer is NO** → Person is NOT capable → They "can't do it"

4. **Select the intervention**:
   - **Can't do it (Capability issue)** → Use Training
   - **Won't do it (Motivation issue)** → Use Motivation strategies

## Management Style Based on Task-Relevant Maturity

Assess the employee's maturity level specifically for the task at hand:

### Immature Employee
- **Action**: Apply hands-on training
- **Critical Constraint**: Do NOT allow "learn by mistakes" approach
- **Reasoning**: Subordinate's "tuition" is paid by customers, which is unacceptable

### Mature Employee
- **Action**: Apply delegate approach (hands-off management)
- **Context**: Employee demonstrates competence for the specific task

## Key Principles
- These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job
- Management style must match task-relevant maturity, not general experience
- The ability to distinguish between hands-on and hands-off approaches distinguishes top managers from average managers

## Constraints
- Does not apply if root cause is external to the individual (e.g., equipment failure)
- Never use "learn by mistakes" for immature employees
