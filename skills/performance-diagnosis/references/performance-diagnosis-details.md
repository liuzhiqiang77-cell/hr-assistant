# Performance Diagnosis Details

## The Life or Death Test - Deeper Context

This diagnostic framework comes from the "Sports Analogy" section of the source material. The test reveals that:

1. **Capability issues (Can't)**: The person lacks the skill, knowledge, or physical ability to perform the task. No amount of motivation will help - they need training.

2. **Motivation issues (Won't)**: The person has the capability but chooses not to apply it. They need motivational interventions.

## Task-Relevant Maturity - Management Insight

This decision-making process distinguishes the top 5% of managers who think deeply about their craft from the 95% who do not.

### Why "Learn by Mistakes" is Wrong for Immature Employees

The text states: "The problem with this is that the subordinate's tuition is paid by his customers. And that is absolutely wrong."

When an immature employee makes mistakes:
- Customers suffer the consequences
- Company reputation is damaged
- Resources are wasted
- The employee may develop bad habits

### Interview Question for Managers

"Is it better to be a hands-on or hands-off manager?"

**Correct answer**: "It depends on the employee's task-relevant maturity."

## Variables

- `life_dependent_capability` (Boolean): Could the person perform the task if their life depended on it?
- `employee_maturity` (Categorical): Immature vs. Mature for the specific task
