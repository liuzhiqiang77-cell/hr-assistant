## Performance Diagnosis Examples

### Example 1: Can't Do It (Capability Issue)
**Situation**: Salesperson consistently fails to close deals.
**Life or Death Test**: "If their life depended on it, could they close a deal?" → NO
**Root Cause**: Lack of closing skills, knowledge of product, or objection handling
**Intervention**: Training on sales techniques, product knowledge, and objection handling

### Example 2: Won't Do It (Motivation Issue)
**Situation**: Experienced engineer stops documenting work.
**Life or Death Test**: "If their life depended on it, could they document their work?" → YES
**Root Cause**: Lack of motivation, sees documentation as waste of time
**Intervention**: Motivation strategies (connect documentation to career impact, recognition)
