# Performance Diagnosis: Can't vs Won't

Apply this diagnostic framework when an individual is not performing their job effectively and you need to determine the root cause.

## When to Use
- When you observe poor performance or failure to do the job
- Before implementing any performance improvement intervention
- When the root cause is NOT external to the individual (e.g., not equipment failure)

## Diagnostic Process

### 1. Identify the Performance Issue
Confirm that the person is not doing their job effectively.

### 2. Apply the 'Life or Death' Mental Test
Ask yourself: **"If the person's life depended on doing the work, could they do it?"**

### 3. Evaluate the Answer

**IF YES → They "won't do it" (Motivation Issue)**
- The person is capable but NOT motivated
- Intervention required: Motivation strategies

**IF NO → They "can't do it" (Capability Issue)**
- The person is NOT capable
- Intervention required: Training

### 4. Select Managerial Intervention
- For 'Can't do it': Provide training to build capability
- For 'Won't do it': Apply motivation strategies to increase drive

## Key Principle
These are the **only two reasons** a person does not do their job. All other interventions are ineffective unless the individual tries to offer their best.
