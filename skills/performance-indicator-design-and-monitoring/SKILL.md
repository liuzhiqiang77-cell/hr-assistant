# Performance Indicator Design and Monitoring

## When to Use
- Designing or selecting performance metrics
- Establishing daily operational review processes
- Tracking progress toward deadlines or monthly goals
- Managing teams with quantitative performance targets

## Principles of Effective Indicator Design

### Core Principles

1. **Attention Principle:** Indicators direct attention like steering a bicycle—you steer where you look
2. **Guard Against Overreaction:** Single metrics can lead to extreme behaviors
3. **Implement Paired Indicators:** Always pair effect with counter-effect to maintain optimum

### Paired Indicator Examples

- Inventory Levels ↔ Incidence of Shortages
- Completion Date ↔ Capability
- Quantity Output ↔ Quality Rating

### Administrative Indicator Criteria

**Rule 1:** Any measurement is better than none

**Rule 2:** Measure **Output** (results), not **Activity** (effort)
- Good: Orders obtained, vouchers processed
- Bad: Calls made, hours worked

**Rule 3:** Measure **Physical/Countable** things
- Examples: Vouchers processed, square feet cleaned, sales orders entered, transactions processed, people hired, items managed

### Administrative Pairing Strategy

Pair Quantity indicators with Quality indicators:

- **Accounts Payable:** # Vouchers processed ↔ # Errors found
- **Custodial:** # Square feet cleaned ↔ Quality rating by senior manager
- **Recruiting:** # Candidates interviewed ↔ # Acceptances

## Daily Operational Indicator Set

Review these indicators daily when starting operations:

1. **Sales Forecast**
   - Number of units planned for delivery today
   - Compare to yesterday's variance to assess confidence

2. **Raw Material Inventory**
   - Verify stock levels (eggs, bread, coffee, etc.)
   - If too low: Order more supplies immediately
   - If too high: Cancel scheduled deliveries

3. **Equipment Condition**
   - Check if any equipment broke down yesterday
   - If breakdown: Arrange repairs or rearrange production line

4. **Manpower**
   - Check staff availability (sick leave, vacancies)
   - If understaffed: Call temporary help or reallocate staff

5. **Quality Indicator**
   - Review customer complaint log
   - If complaints exceed normal: Address with staff immediately

## Linearity Indicator Analysis

Track progress against a linear trajectory to the goal.

### Procedure

1. **Plot Actual Output:** Graph actual results against time elapsed
2. **Define Ideal Line:** Linear path from start point to final target
3. **Compare Progress:**
   - Below line: Accelerate performance immediately
   - Back-loaded (end-heavy): Address resource allocation inefficiency
4. **Take Corrective Action:** Use as early warning before deadline

### Interpretation

- **Below Ideal Line:** Higher rate needed in remaining period
- **Concentrated at End:** Inefficient resource usage
- **Purpose:** Early warning to allow time for correction

## Procedure

1. **Design Indicators:** Apply paired indicator principles
2. **Establish Daily Review:** Implement operational indicator checklist
3. **Track Linearity:** Monitor progress against linear trajectory
4. **Take Action:** Respond to deviations immediately

## Key Variables
- `primary_metric`: Main indicator being tracked
- `counter_metric`: Opposing indicator to prevent overreaction
- `output_measure`: Physical count of results
- `quality_measure`: Assessment of work standard
- `variance`: Difference between planned and actual
