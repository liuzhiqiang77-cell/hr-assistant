# Retention Conversation Scripts

## Opening the Conversation

**Manager:** "I was surprised to hear you're resigning. Can you sit down and tell me what's behind this decision?"

**Manager:** "Before we go any further, I want to understand your perspective completely. Please tell me everything that led to this decision."

## During the Explanation

**Manager:** "Go on, I'm listening."

**Manager:** "That's an important point. Can you tell me more about that?"

**Manager:** "I see. And what else?"

**Manager:** "Thank you for being honest with me. I appreciate you sharing that."

## After Understanding the Issues

**Manager:** "I hear what you're saying, and I can see why you'd feel that way. I'm not going to try to talk you out of this right now. I need some time to think about what you've shared and see what we can do. Can we meet again tomorrow?"

## Presenting the Solution

**Manager:** "I've spoken with [supervisor's name] and we've been discussing what you shared. We realize we've dropped the ball in some areas, and we want to fix that."

**Manager:** "Here's what we can do: [specific solution]. This addresses your concerns about [specific issue]."

**Manager (Reframing):** "I want to be clear about something. You didn't blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways. This is on us to fix, not on you to demand."

## Countering External Offers

**Manager:** "I understand you've accepted another position. But I want you to think about the commitments you've made."

**Manager:** "You have a commitment to this new company—a company you don't really know yet, where you'll be working with strangers."

**Manager:** "But you also have a commitment to this team—to me, to [colleague names], to the people you work with every day. Those commitments are real and they're strong."

**Manager:** "Which commitment means more to you? The one to a casual new acquaintance, or the one to the colleagues who've been by your side for [time period]?"

## Closing

**Manager:** "I'm glad you're staying. Let's make sure we don't end up in this situation again. I'd like to check in with you regularly to make sure things are on track."
