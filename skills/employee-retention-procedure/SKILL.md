# Employee Retention Procedure

## When to Use
- A valued subordinate announces resignation
- The subordinate feels work is unappreciated
- The subordinate is highly valued, dedicated, and loyal
- The resignation is NOT solely motivated by money or perks at another company

## When NOT to Use
- The employee is purely motivated by better financial offers elsewhere
- The employee is not considered "valued" or "dedicated"
- The resignation is driven solely by compensation

## Step 1: Immediate Reaction (The Opening Skirmish)

**Drop what you are doing immediately.**

1. Sit the subordinate down
2. Ask why he is quitting
3. **Let him talk completely**—do not argue, lecture, or panic
4. Allow him to deliver rehearsed points
5. Ask more questions to uncover real issues
6. Convey through actions that he is important to you
7. **Do not try to change his mind yet**—focus on buying time to prepare for the next round

## Step 2: Supervisor Involvement

1. Go to your supervisor for help and advice
2. Make the resignation your supervisor's problem
3. Ensure they participate in the solution

## Step 3: Corporate Citizenship & Solution Pursuit

1. Vigorously pursue every avenue to keep the employee with the firm
2. This may mean transferring him to another department
3. Become the project manager of the solution until settled

**Golden Rule:** You owe it to the employer to save an employee for the company (reciprocity among managers).

## Step 4: Presenting the Solution

1. Return with a solution that:
   - Addresses real reasons for leaving
   - Benefits the company
2. Reframe the situation to alleviate fears of being viewed as a "blackmailer"

**Key Script:**
> "You did not blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways."

## Step 5: Countering External Offers

If the subordinate has accepted another job:

1. Make him "quit again" (renounce the other offer)
2. Use this argument:
   - He has made two commitments:
     - One to a vague potential employer
     - One to you/his current team
   - Commitments to daily colleagues are far stronger than those to a "casual new acquaintance"

## Key Variables

- **subordinate_status**: The perceived value and loyalty of the employee (e.g., 'valued', 'dedicated')
- **resignation_reason**: The underlying cause for leaving (e.g., 'feeling unappreciated')
- **external_offer_status**: Whether the subordinate has already accepted a position elsewhere

## Expected Outcome

- Subordinate retains employment with the company
- Potentially in a new role or department
- Successfully withdraws external resignation

## Core Principles

1. **Listen first, act second**—understand the real issues before proposing solutions
2. **Make it a team effort**—involve your supervisor
3. **Corporate citizenship**—save talent for the company, not just your team
4. **Reframe the narrative**—the resignation revealed problems we should have fixed anyway
5. **Leverage relationships**—daily colleague bonds are stronger than new job offers
