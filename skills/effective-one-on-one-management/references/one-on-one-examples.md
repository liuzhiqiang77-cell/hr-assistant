## Zinger Management

A "Zinger" is when a subordinate drops a major issue (e.g., resignation, serious complaint) at the very end of a meeting.

### Prevention Strategies
- Reserve 15-20 minutes at end for "any other concerns"
- Ask: "Is there anything else on your mind, even if it seems difficult to discuss?"
- Notice body language suggesting withheld information

### When a Zinger Occurs
- Acknowledge the importance immediately
- Don't rush to solve
- Schedule dedicated follow-up meeting if needed
- Document the issue raised
