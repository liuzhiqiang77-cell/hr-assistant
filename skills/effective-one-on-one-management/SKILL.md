# Effective One-on-One Management

## When to Use
- Scheduling recurring one-on-one meetings with direct reports
- Improving existing one-on-one meeting effectiveness
- Adapting meeting frequency for larger teams with electronic communication
- Addressing communication gaps with subordinates

## Determine Meeting Frequency

### Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)
Evaluate the subordinate's experience with the **specific task at hand**, not their general experience or age.

### Base Frequency Rules
- **Inexperienced in specific situation**: Meet weekly
- **Experienced veteran**: Meet every few weeks

### Adjust for Rate of Change
- **High rate of change** (e.g., Marketing): Increase frequency to stay current on rapid developments
- **Low rate of change** (e.g., Research): Decrease frequency

### Adapt for Electronic Communication
When electronic information sharing is available and span of control has increased:
- Reduce frequency compared to traditional standards
- Shorten meeting duration
- Focus on coaching and specific issues rather than general status updates

## Manage Meeting Logistics

### Duration
- **Minimum**: 1 hour
- Anything less causes subordinates to confine discussion to simple issues

### Location
- **Preferred**: In or near the subordinate's work area
- **Benefits**: Observe organization, document retrieval efficiency, interruption patterns, work approach

### Ownership
- The meeting is the **subordinate's meeting**
- Subordinate sets agenda and tone
- Subordinate must prepare an outline in advance

### Scheduling
- Use **rolling basis**: Set up next meeting as current one ends
- Avoids cancellations from fixed schedules

### Remote Meetings
- Supervisor must have the outline before meeting begins
- Exchange notes after meeting to confirm commitments

## Conduct the Meeting

### Content Scope
Cover these categories:
- Performance figures and indicators (especially trouble signals)
- Events since last meeting (hiring, people problems, organizational issues, future plans)
- Potential problems (even intangible intuitions)
- Issues that preoccupy and nag the subordinate

### Supervisor Role: Facilitate and Coach
- **Objective**: Facilitate expression of concerns, learn, and coach
- **Grove's Principle of Didactic Management**: "Ask one more question!"—when you think the subordinate is finished, ask another query to reach the root problem

### Mechanical Hints
- **Note-taking**: Both parties take notes on the outline
  - Keeps mind from drifting
  - Aids digestion
  - Forces logical categorization
  - Writing implies commitment to action
- **Hold File**: Both parties accumulate important non-urgent issues
  - Applies batching principle
  - Minimizes ad hoc interruptions

### Handle Heart-to-Heart Issues
- Encourage discussion of deep work-related problems
- **Beware the Zinger**: A major issue raised at the end with insufficient time to resolve

## Key Principles
- Never treat as casual encounters or mission-oriented meetings
- Supervisor should avoid dominating the conversation
- Focus on mutual education and exchange of information
- Validate that one-on-ones remain necessary despite electronic updates
