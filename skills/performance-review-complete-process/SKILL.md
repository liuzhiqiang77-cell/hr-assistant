# Performance Review Complete Process

Use this skill to conduct effective performance reviews, from preparation through delivery. This skill covers both the preparation phase for mixed assessments and the delivery framework using the Three L's.

## When to Use

- When preparing for a performance review containing both positive and negative assessments
- When delivering a performance review or assessment to a subordinate

## Phase 1: Preparation (Mixed Assessments)

Use this strategy when preparing for reviews with mixed positive and negative content.

### Step 1: Data Scanning

Review all available material including:
- Progress reports
- Performance against quarterly objectives
- One-on-one meeting notes

### Step 2: Brainstorming (The Worksheet)

1. Sit with a blank piece of paper
2. Write "everything down" regarding the subordinate's performance
3. "Do not edit in your head"
4. Include "Things major, minor, and trivial" in no particular order
5. **Important:** Writing items down does not commit you to doing anything

### Step 3: Documentation Removal

Once you run out of items, "put all of your supporting documentation away"

### Step 4: Relationship Analysis

Look for relationships between items on the worksheet. Identify if items are:
- "Different manifestations of the same phenomenon"
- Indications of why strengths/weaknesses exist

### Step 5: Message Formulation

Convert identified relationships into "messages" for the subordinate

### Step 6: Evidence Gathering

From the worksheet, "draw conclusions and specific examples to support them"

### Step 7: Filtering

Ask yourself: Will the subordinate be able to remember all the messages chosen?

If not, "delete the less important ones." Excluded items can be taken up in the next review.

### Step 8: Handling Surprises

Ideally, regular supervision should prevent surprises. However, if the worksheet reveals a message that "startles you," you must deliver it to improve performance.

**Action:** "Swallow hard and bring it up"

## Phase 2: Delivery (The Three L's)

When delivering the assessment, apply the Three L's framework.

### 1. Level

You must level with your subordinate.

- **Requirement:** Be totally frank
- **Rationale:** The credibility and integrity of the entire system depend on your being totally frank
- **Challenge:** Do not be surprised to find that praising someone in a straightforward fashion can be just as hard as criticizing him without embarrassment

### 2. Listen

Employ your entire arsenal of sensory capabilities to ensure points are interpreted by the subordinate's brain.

**Goal:** Transmit thoughts from your brain to theirs; words are just the means, getting the right thought communicated is the end.

**Constraint:** Do NOT use a tape recorder to confirm words used.

**Identify Barriers:** Watch for signs that the subordinate is:
- Too emotional to understand clear points
- Preoccupied trying to formulate answers rather than listening
- Tuned out (e.g., thinking of going fishing) as a defense mechanism, especially if the message is laden with conflict

**Verification Techniques:**
- Watch the person you are talking to
- Check for appropriate verbal and nonverbal responses
- Check if they allow themselves to receive your message

**Responsibility:** If responses do not completely assure you that the message has gotten through, keep at it until you are satisfied that you have been heard and understood.

**Adjustment:** If not understood, explain things again or explain things in a different way. Do not look away (like at a blackboard) to avoid confirming the presentation is murky.

### 3. Leave Yourself Out

Ensure the review focuses solely on the subordinate.

- **Principle:** The performance review is about and for your subordinate
- **Constraint:** Keep your own insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or other emotions out of it
- **Context:** At issue are the subordinate's problems; it is the subordinate's day in court
- **Emotion Management:** Control strong emotions (similar to stage fright) so they do not affect your task, acknowledging they may well up regardless of experience

## Constraints

- Do not use tape recorders to confirm words
- Do not imitate professors who avoid eye contact
- Supervisor's personal emotions should not influence the content
