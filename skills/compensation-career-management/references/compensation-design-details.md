# Detailed Compensation Design Framework

## Bonus Factor Weighting Considerations

### Organizational Level Appropriate Weighting

| Level | Individual | Team | Corporate | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Individual Contributor | 80% | 20% | 0% | Direct impact on own work |
| Team Lead | 50% | 40% | 10% | Balances team and individual |
| Middle Manager | 40% | 40% | 20% | Significant team/department responsibility |
| Senior Manager | 30% | 40% | 30% | Broad organizational impact |
| Executive | 20% | 30% | 50% | Company-level results paramount |

### Timing Best Practices

| Bonus Type | Recommended Payment Frequency | Reasoning |
|------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| Sales/Revenue | Monthly/Quarterly | Clear linkage to effort |
| Project-based | On project completion | Immediate feedback loop |
| Strategic/Long-term | Annually (with 1-year lag) | Accounts for time offset |
| Corporate performance | Annually | Aligns with financial reporting |

### Metric Selection Guidelines

**Countable Items (Financial):**
- Pros: Objective, easy to measure
- Cons: May encourage wrong behaviors (gaming)
- Examples: Revenue, profit margin, cost savings

**Measurable Objectives:**
- Pros: Goal-directed, flexible
- Cons: May be gamed if not carefully designed
- Examples: OKRs, KPIs, customer satisfaction scores

**Subjective Elements:**
- Pros: Capture qualitative aspects, cultural fit
- Cons: Risk of "beauty contest", bias
- **Mitigation**: Use multiple raters, calibration meetings, specific behavioral criteria

## Promotion Criteria Framework

### Readiness Assessment Checklist

Before promoting, verify:

- [ ] **Current Performance**: Consistently exceeds requirements in current role (minimum 6-12 months)

- [ ] **Strategic Thinking**: Demonstrated understanding of broader organizational context
- [ ] **Problem Solving**: Proven ability to handle complex, ambiguous situations
- [ ] **Independence**: Can work with minimal supervision on complex tasks

### Promotion Decision Matrix

| Current Performance | Future Potential | Growth Mindset | Decision |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| Exceeds | High | Yes | **Promote** |
| Exceeds | Medium | Yes | Promote with support |
| Exceeds | Low | No | Develop in place |
| Meets | High | Yes | Development plan |

## Recycling Implementation Protocol

### Preparation Phase
1. **Documentation**: Gather evidence of previous success and current struggles
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify specific capabilities lacking for current role
3. **Role Availability**: Confirm previous role or equivalent is available
4. **Support Planning**: Prepare transition support (coaching, adjusted goals)

### Conversation Guide

**Opening**:
> "We've promoted you to [Role] based on your excellent performance in [Previous Role]. However, we've seen that this role isn't leveraging your strengths the way we hoped."

**Acknowledgment of Accountability**:
> "I want to be clear: we misjudged the readiness requirements for this role. That's on us, not you."

**The Proposal**:
> "We'd like you to return to [Previous Role] where you excelled. We believe you can make a significant impact there."

**Addressing Concerns**:
> "We understand this feels like a step back. But it's not a judgment of your capability—it's about placing you where you can succeed and contribute most."

**Future Outlook**:
> "We see this as a reset. As you regain confidence and perhaps develop new skills, other opportunities will open up. You're a valued member of this team."

### Follow-Up Actions
- Schedule regular check-ins during transition (weekly for first month)
- Set clear, achievable goals in returned role
- Provide public acknowledgement of return to strength (reduce stigma)
- Document conversation and agreement
- Identify development areas for future promotion consideration
