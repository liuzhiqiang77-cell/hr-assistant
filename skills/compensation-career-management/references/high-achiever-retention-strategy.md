# High Achiever Retention and Development

## Why This Matters

High achievers account for a disproportionately large share of work output. Improving their performance is a 'high-leverage activity' where impact on group output is very great.

**Common Pitfall**: Supervisors spend effort justifying high ratings but give little attention to how high achievers could do even better.

## High Achiever Review Strategy

### 1. Shift from Retrospective to Developmental

**Traditional Review (Retrospective):**
- Focuses on what subordinate did in prior year
- Justifies the judgment of superior performance
- Little attention to future improvement

**High Achiever Review (Developmental):**
- Acknowledges past success (briefly)
- Focuses on how to do even better
- Defines specific actions for future improvement or maintaining excellence

### 2. Identify High-Leverage Development Areas

For high achievers, focus development on:

**Strategic Thinking:**
- Understanding broader business context
- Anticipating market changes
- Identifying new opportunities

**Leadership Expansion:**
- Mentoring others
- Leading cross-functional initiatives
- Influencing without authority

**Skill Depth:**
- Becoming subject matter expert
- Mastering adjacent skills
- Staying current with industry advances

### 3. Create Specific Action Plans

Avoid vague directives like "keep up the good work."

**Example Action Plan:**

| Area | Current State | Development Goal | Specific Actions | Timeline |
|------|---------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Technical Expertise | Advanced in core tech | Recognized expert | Lead 2 major tech initiatives, publish 1 paper, present at 1 conference | 12 months |
| Leadership | Leads team well | Leads org-wide change | Chair cross-functional committee, mentor 2 junior staff | 6 months |
| Strategic Thinking | Good at tactics | Strong strategic insight | Participate in strategic planning, present strategic analysis to exec team | 9 months |

### 4. Address Common High Achiever Concerns

**Boredom/Lack of Challenge:**
- New assignments or projects
- Role expansion or job crafting
- Rotation to different functions

**Compensation Alignment:**
- Ensure compensation reflects value
- Consider variable compensation tied to higher-impact outcomes
- Explore non-monetary recognition

**Career Path Visibility:**
- Clear path to next level
- Understanding of requirements for advancement
- Regular discussion of long-term goals

## Comparison: High Achiever vs. Poor Performer Reviews

| Aspect | High Achiever | Poor Performer |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Time Spent | Often minimal | Extensive (corrective action programs) |
| Focus Area | Justifying rating | Detailed improvement plan |
| Specificity | Vague ("keep it up") | Specific steps and milestones |
| Future Orientation | Limited | Clear and structured |
| **What Should Be** | Specific development steps | Clear PIP with accountability |

## Retention Risk Signals

Watch for these signs that high achievers may be at risk:

- Decreased engagement or enthusiasm
- Reduced initiative or going through motions
- Increased questioning of decisions or direction
- More time spent on external networking
- Decline in performance (though still above average)
- Expressions of frustration or stagnation

## Proactive Retention Actions

1. **Regular Career Conversations**: Quarterly check-ins on career goals and satisfaction
2. **Stretch Assignments**: Provide challenges that require growth
3. **Recognition**: Public and private acknowledgment of contributions
4. **Autonomy**: Increased decision-making authority
5. **Visibility**: Exposure to senior leadership and broader organization
6. **Development Investment**: Training, conferences, coaching support
