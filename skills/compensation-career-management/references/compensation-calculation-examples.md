# Compensation Calculation Examples

## Example 1: Middle Manager Bonus Calculation

**Situation**: Middle Manager with $150,000 total compensation.

**Bonus Design**:
- Target: 20% of total compensation = $30,000
- 3-Factor Split:
  - Individual Performance: 50% = $15,000
  - Department Performance: 30% = $9,000
  - Corporate Performance: 20% = $6,000

**Payout Calculation**:
- Individual Rating: "Exceeds" = 120% = $18,000
- Department Target: Achieved = 100% = $9,000
- Corporate Target: Missed = 80% = $4,800
- **Total Bonus**: $31,800

## Example 2: Senior Manager Bonus Design

**Situation**: Senior Manager with $400,000 total compensation.

**Bonus Design**:
- Target: 40% of total compensation = $160,000
- 3-Factor Split:
  - Individual Performance: 40% = $64,000
  - Division Performance: 40% = $64,000
  - Corporate Performance: 20% = $32,000

**Rationale**: Higher percentage needed for motivational impact at higher compensation levels.

## Promotion Cycle Examples

## Example 1: Successful Promotion Cycle

**Year 1-2**: Software Engineer
- Performance: Meets requirements
- Learning role, building skills

**Year 3-4**: Software Engineer
- Performance: Exceeds requirements
- Delivering high-quality code, mentoring others
- **Action**: Promoted to Senior Engineer

**Year 5**: Senior Engineer
- Performance: Meets requirements (reset)
- Learning new responsibilities, architecture

**Year 6-7**: Senior Engineer
- Performance: Exceeds requirements
- Leading projects, technical leadership
- **Action**: Promoted to Tech Lead

## Example 2: Atrophy Risk

**Year 1-3**: Engineer
- Performance: Exceeds requirements
- Ready for promotion
- **Problem**: No promotion available (budget freeze)

**Year 4-5**: Engineer
- Performance: Returns to "meets requirements"
- Motivation declines, engagement drops
- **Risk**: Permanent atrophy, talent loss

## Recycling Examples

## Example 1: Successful Recycling

**Situation**: Top individual contributor promoted to manager, struggling after 6 months.

**Problem**: Missing deadlines, team morale issues, overwhelmed.

**Previous Role**: Senior Engineer, top performer, loved by team.

**Action**: 
1. Manager admits: "I misjudged your readiness for management"
2. Offer: "Return to Senior Engineer role with 10% raise"
3. Public communication: "John is returning to technical leadership where he excels"

**Outcome**:
- Short embarrassment (2-3 weeks)
- Regained confidence as top engineer
- 18 months later: Promoted to manager again, succeeds

## Example 2: Failed Recycling (What Not to Do)

**Situation**: Promoted employee struggling.

**Wrong Action**: Quiet demotion, title change without explanation.

**Consequences**:
- Employee feels punished, not supported
- Stigma and rumors spread
- Employee leaves company
- Loss of valuable talent

**Correct Approach**: Open, transparent recycling with management accountability.
