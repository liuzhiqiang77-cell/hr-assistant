# Monitoring Delegated Tasks: Examples

## Lowest-Added-Value Stage Examples

### Report Writing
- **Monitor**: Outline and rough draft
- **Don't wait for**: Final polished document
- **Catch early**: Missing key sections, wrong focus, structural issues

### Software Development
- **Monitor**: Design document and initial code structure
- **Don't wait for**: Completed feature with bugs
- **Catch early**: Architectural problems, misunderstood requirements

### Project Management
- **Monitor**: Project plan and early milestone progress
- **Don't wait for**: Missed deadline
- **Catch early**: Resource gaps, unrealistic timelines

## TRM-Based Monitoring Schedule

### Low TRM (New to Task)
- **Frequency**: Daily check-ins initially
- **Focus**: Understanding requirements, approach validation
- **Duration**: Until first successful completion

### Medium TRM (Some Experience)
- **Frequency**: Weekly reviews
- **Focus**: Quality, efficiency, problem-solving
- **Duration**: Until consistent performance demonstrated

### High TRM (Experienced)
- **Frequency**: Monthly or milestone-based reviews
- **Focus**: Outcomes, strategic alignment
- **Duration**: Ongoing, minimal oversight

## Sampling Techniques

### Random Spot Checks
- Review 20-30% of deliverables randomly
- Varies timing to prevent gaming
- Focus on different aspects each time

### Risk-Based Sampling
- Increase sampling when:
  - High-stakes deliverables
  - New team members
  - Complex or unfamiliar tasks
- Decrease sampling when:
  - Routine, well-understood work
  - Proven track record
  - Low-risk outcomes
