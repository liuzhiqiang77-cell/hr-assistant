# Operational Values Examples

## What Are Operational Values?

Operational values define "the correct way to do things" and priorities within an organization. They are not mission statements or aspirational values—they are practical, day-to-day working principles.

## Examples by Function

### Engineering
- "Always document before coding"
- "Test at the unit level before integration"
- "Security is considered in every design decision"

### Sales
- "Never promise what we cannot deliver"
- "Customer satisfaction trumps short-term revenue"
- "Always follow up within 24 hours"

### Manufacturing
- "Safety is never compromised for speed"
- "Quality checks happen at every stage, not just the end"
- "Clean workspace equals safe workspace"

### Customer Support
- "First contact resolution is the goal"
- "Empathy before efficiency"
- "Escalate when you cannot solve within SLA"

## How to Teach Operational Values

1. **Explicit Statement**: Clearly articulate the value
2. **Demonstration**: Show the value in action (role modeling)
3. **Reinforcement**: Praise adherence, correct deviations
4. **Explanation**: Explain the "why" behind the value
5. **Consistency**: Apply the value consistently yourself

## Signs Values Are Not Shared

- Subordinate makes decisions you would not make
- Work quality doesn't meet your standards
- Customer complaints about approach (not just outcome)
- Subordinate surprises you with their methods
- You feel the need to check every detail
