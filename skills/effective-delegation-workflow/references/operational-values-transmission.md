# Transmitting Operational Values

## What Are Operational Values?
The correct way to do things and priorities within the organization.

## The Teaching Process

### 1. Explicit Communication
- State values clearly
- Explain "why" behind procedures
- Provide examples of correct behavior

### 2. Modeling
- Demonstrate values through actions
- Make values visible in daily work
- Consistency is critical

### 3. Reinforcement
- Acknowledge when values are demonstrated
- Correct deviations immediately
- Use mistakes as teaching moments (before customer impact)

### 4. Internalization
- Goal: Structure moves from externally imposed to internally adopted
- Timeline: Varies by individual and task complexity
- Sign of success: Subordinate makes decisions aligned with values without prompting

## Common Pitfalls

### Customer Tuition
- **Definition**: Letting subordinates learn through customer-impacting mistakes
- **Problem**: Customers pay for the learning curve
- **Solution**: Supervisor teaches correct values before customer-facing work

### Assuming Shared Understanding
- **Mistake**: Believing values are obvious
- **Reality**: Values must be explicitly taught and reinforced
- **Fix**: Regular check-ins on decision-making rationale
