# Task-Relevant Maturity in Delegation

## What is TRM?

Task-Relevant Maturity is a combination of:
- Achievement orientation (drive to achieve)
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience **specific to the task**

## TRM is Task-Specific

A person can have:
- High TRM in one job (e.g., writing code)
- Low TRM in another job (e.g., managing people)

Even seasoned managers may have low TRM if:
- The environment is new
- The content is unfamiliar
- The tasks are different
- The pace accelerates abruptly

## Monitoring Frequency by TRM

| TRM Level | Monitoring Frequency | Example |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| Low | Daily or multiple times per week | New hire on first project |
| Medium/Growing | Weekly | Subordinate learning new skill |
| High | Bi-weekly or monthly | Experienced veteran on familiar work |

## TRM Can Change Rapidly

TRM is not static—it can change:
- Day by day (as subordinate gains experience)
- Hour by hour (as pace or context shifts)
- When job responsibilities change
- When organizational conditions shift

Always reassess TRM before adjusting monitoring intensity.
