# Task-Relevant Maturity Examples

## High TRM in One Area, Low in Another

A senior software engineer with 10 years of experience:
- **High TRM**: Writing backend code in their primary language
- **Low TRM**: Leading a team of 5 people (new management responsibility)
- **Low TRM**: Working with a new framework they've never used

## TRM Changes Over Time

### Scenario: Rapid Job Change
A marketing manager promoted to VP of Marketing:
- **Before promotion**: High TRM in marketing campaigns
- **Immediately after**: Low TRM in strategic planning and budgeting
- **After 6 months**: Medium/Growing TRM as they gain experience

### Scenario: Accelerating Pace
A production line supervisor:
- **Normal pace**: High TRM in managing the line
- **During crisis**: TRM drops as pace accelerates beyond normal experience

## TRM vs General Maturity

| Person | General Maturity | TRM for Specific Task |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Experienced executive | High | Low (new to social media marketing) |
| Young graduate | Low | High (grew up with the technology) |
| Long-tenured employee | High | Low (job role completely changed) |
