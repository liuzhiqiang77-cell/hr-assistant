# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

## Definition

Task-Relevant Maturity is a combination of:
- The degree of the subordinate's achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience relevant to the specific task

## Key Characteristics

### Specificity
- TRM is very specific to the task at hand
- A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another
- Even seasoned managers may have low TRM if environment, content, or tasks are new

### Dynamic Nature
- TRM can change day by day or hour by hour
- TRM can drop if job pace accelerates
- TRM can drop if the job itself abruptly changes

### Distinction from General Competence
- Do not confuse general competence/maturity with task-relevant maturity
- High general maturity does not guarantee high TRM in a new role

## Factors Causing Low TRM

- New environment or work context
- Unfamiliar task content
- Accelerated job pace
- Abrupt job changes
- Lack of specific training or experience

## TRM Levels

- **Low:** Requires close supervision, detailed instructions
- **Medium/Growing:** Requires some guidance, periodic check-ins
- **High:** Requires minimal supervision, outcome-focused monitoring
