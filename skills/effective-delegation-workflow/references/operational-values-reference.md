# Operational Values Reference

## Definition
Operational values are "the correct way to do things" and priorities within the organization.

## Components
- How the organization works together
- Shared priorities and preferences
- Accepted methods and approaches
- Decision-making criteria

## Why Essential for Delegation
Without shared operational values:
- Subordinates cannot make acceptable decisions independently
- Manager must provide specific instructions for every task
- Leverage is severely reduced
- Manager remains bottleneck for decisions

## Supervisor's Teaching Responsibility
1. Transmit common values explicitly
2. Teach subordinate the "correct way" early
3. Prevent learning through customer-impacting mistakes
4. Ensure values are internalized, not just imposed

## Progression
As TRM grows:
- Structure moves from externally imposed → internally adopted
- Subordinate makes decisions consistent with values without supervision
- Manager can delegate with confidence
