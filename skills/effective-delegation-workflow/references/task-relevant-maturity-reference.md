# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

Task-Relevant Maturity is a critical concept used throughout delegation and monitoring.

## Definition

TRM is a combination of:
- The degree of the subordinate's achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience

## Key Characteristics

- **Task-Specific**: TRM is very specific to the task at hand. A person can have high TRM in one job but low in another.
- **Dynamic**: TRM can change day by day or hour by hour.
- **Not General Maturity**: Do not confuse general competence and maturity with task-relevant maturity. High general maturity does not guarantee high TRM in a new role.

## Factors Causing Low TRM

- New environment, content, or tasks
- Accelerated pace of the job
- Abrupt changes in the job itself

## TRM Levels

- **Low**: Subordinate is inexperienced in the specific situation
- **Medium/Growing**: Subordinate is developing competence
- **High**: Subordinate is an experienced veteran with the specific task

## Application

TRM determines:
- Delegation approach
- One-on-one meeting frequency
- Monitoring intensity
- Management style (close vs. loose supervision)
