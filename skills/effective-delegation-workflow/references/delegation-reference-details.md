# Delegation Reference Details

## Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM) Factors

TRM is NOT general maturity or competence. It is specific to the task at hand.

### Components of TRM
1. **Achievement Orientation**: The degree to which the subordinate is driven to achieve
2. **Readiness for Responsibility**: Willingness to be accountable for outcomes
3. **Experience/Education**: Relevant training and background specific to the task

### When TRM Can Drop
- The environment, content, and tasks are new to the person
- The pace of the job accelerates
- The job itself abruptly changes

### Example Scenarios
- A seasoned manager may have low TRM in a new role
- An experienced engineer may have low TRM when switching to management
- TRM can be high for routine tasks but low for novel challenges

## Monitoring Examples

### Lowest-Added-Value Stage Examples
- Review rough report outlines before full drafts
- Check project plans before execution begins
- Review code architecture before implementation
- Check sales call scripts before customer meetings

### Sampling Approach
- For a 20-item checklist, randomly review 3-5 items
- For weekly reports, spot-check one section in detail
- For customer interactions, review a sample of call logs
