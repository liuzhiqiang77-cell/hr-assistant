# Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

## Definition

Task-Relevant Maturity is a combination of:
- The degree of the subordinate's achievement orientation
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience **specific to the task**

## Key Characteristics

### Specificity
TRM is very specific to the task at hand. A person can have:
- High TRM in one job
- Low TRM in another job

Even a seasoned manager may have low TRM if:
- The environment is new to them
- The content and tasks are unfamiliar
- The pace of the job accelerates abruptly
- The job itself changes suddenly

### Distinction from General Competence

Do not confuse general competence/maturity with task-relevant maturity:
- High general maturity ≠ high TRM in a new role
- A capable executive may need close supervision when tackling unfamiliar responsibilities

### Dynamic Nature

TRM can change:
- Day by day
- Hour by hour (in fast-paced environments)

Always assess TRM for the specific task and current context, not based on past performance in different areas.

## Factors Affecting TRM

1. **Achievement Orientation**: How driven is the subordinate to achieve results?
2. **Readiness for Responsibility**: Willingness to be accountable for outcomes
3. **Relevant Experience**: Prior work with similar tasks
4. **Education/Training**: Formal or informal learning applicable to the task
5. **Environmental Familiarity**: Understanding of the context and constraints
6. **Pace of Work**: How quickly the task or environment is changing

## Using TRM in Management

### Delegation Decisions
- Low TRM → Delegate with close supervision
- Medium TRM → Delegate with periodic check-ins
- High TRM → Delegate with outcome-focused monitoring

### Meeting Frequency
- Low TRM → Meet weekly or more often
- High TRM → Meet bi-weekly or monthly

### Management Style
- Low TRM → Structured, directive approach
- High TRM → Loose, supportive approach
