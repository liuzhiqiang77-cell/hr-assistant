# Delegation Reference Material

## TRM Factors in Detail

### Achievement Orientation
The degree to which the subordinate is driven to achieve results. Signs of high achievement orientation:
- Takes initiative without prompting
- Sets personal standards above requirements
- Seeks feedback and improvement opportunities
- Demonstrates persistence through obstacles

### Readiness for Responsibility
Willingness to be accountable for outcomes. Indicators include:
- Volunteers for challenging assignments
- Admits mistakes and learns from them
- Makes decisions within their authority without excessive checking
- Stands behind their work

### Relevant Experience/Education
- Direct experience with similar tasks or technologies
- Formal training in relevant methodologies
- Prior successful performance with comparable work

## Common Delegation Pitfalls

### Reverse Delegation (The Monkey)
When subordinates bring problems back to you instead of solving them:
- Ask: "What do you think we should do?"
- Require them to propose solutions before you provide guidance
- Reference the original delegated task's ownership

### Over-Delegation
Signs you've delegated too much:
- You lack context to make decisions about the work
- Stakeholders come to you for answers you can't provide
- The quality of output surprises you (good or bad)

### Under-Delegation
Signs you're holding onto too much:
- You're working excessive hours
- Your subordinates complain about lack of development
- You become the bottleneck for decisions

## Monitoring Techniques by TRM Level

### Low TRM (Close Supervision)
- Check work at earliest possible stage
- Daily or very frequent check-ins
- Provide detailed feedback on approach
- Use more directive style

### Medium TRM (Coaching)
- Check at key milestones
- Weekly or bi-weekly check-ins
- Ask questions to guide problem-solving
- Gradually reduce direction

### High TRM (Loose Supervision)
- Focus on results, not process
- Monthly or quarterly reviews
- Serve as resource, not director
- Provide feedback only on exceptions or strategic alignment
