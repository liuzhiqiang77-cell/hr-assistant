# Effective Delegation Workflow

## When to Use This Skill
- Preparing to delegate new tasks to subordinates
- Building delegation capability with a team
- Monitoring work that has been assigned to others
- Establishing operational foundations for managerial progression

## Step 1: Establish Shared Operational Values

Effective delegation requires a common understanding of how the organization works together. As a supervisor, you are accountable for your subordinate's output and cannot delegate without shared values.

**Teaching Responsibility:**
- Transmit common values, priorities, and preferences
- The responsibility for teaching rests squarely with the supervisor
- As TRM grows, structure moves from externally imposed to internally adopted

**Prevent "Customer Tuition":**
- Do not allow subordinates to learn by making mistakes paid for by customers (internal or external)
- Teach correct operational values early on

## Step 2: Assess Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)

TRM is specific to the task, not general competence. It combines:
- Achievement orientation (drive to succeed)
- Readiness to take responsibility
- Education, training, and experience **relevant to the specific task**

**Important:** A person with high general maturity can have low TRM in a new role. TRM can change day by day or hour by hour as conditions change.

Determine TRM level:
- **Low:** New to task, environment, or content; rapid pace of work
- **Medium/Growing:** Gaining experience and familiarity
- **High:** Experienced, ready to take full responsibility

## Step 3: Select and Delegate Tasks

### Prerequisite Check
Ensure delegator and delegatee share a **common information base** and operational ideas. Without this, delegation requires specific instructions and yields low leverage.

### Task Selection Rule
When given a choice, **delegate activities familiar to you rather than unfamiliar ones**. It is easier to monitor tasks you know best.

### Avoid Insincere Delegation
Do not emotionally hold onto tasks while pretending to delegate. If you keep a task because you enjoy it, make it a conscious decision rather than a charade.

### The Golden Rule
"**Delegation without follow-through is abdication.**" You never wash your hands of the task; you remain responsible for its accomplishment.

## Step 4: Monitor Delegated Tasks

Monitoring ensures the activity proceeds in line with expectations. Do not become confused with "meddling" - prescribing specific activities.

### Quality Assurance Principle 1: Timing
Monitor at the **lowest-added-value stage** of the process.
- Review rough drafts of reports rather than waiting for final polished versions
- Catch basic content problems early before expensive polishing

### Quality Assurance Principle 2: Sampling
Do not check 100% of details (like 100% QA testing). Go into details randomly just enough to ensure satisfactory progress.

### Adjust Frequency Based on TRM
- **Low TRM (newly delegated tasks):** Increase monitoring frequency
- **Increasing TRM:** Decrease intensity as subordinate's work improves over time
- **High TRM:** Minimal monitoring needed

Monitoring should decrease as the subordinate demonstrates competence with the specific task.
