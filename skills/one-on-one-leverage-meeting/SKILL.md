# One-on-One Leverage Meeting

## When to Use This Skill
- A supervisor schedules a recurring one-on-one meeting with a subordinate (e.g., every two weeks)
- You need to establish a "common base of information" for effective delegation
- You want the subordinate to teach you specific operational details
- You need to jointly analyze data and make strategic decisions
- You want to multiply the impact of a single meeting across the organization

## Procedure

### 1. Calculate Leverage Potential
Recognize that a small time investment (e.g., 1.5 hours) can:
- Enhance the quality of a subordinate's work for a significant duration (e.g., two weeks or 80+ hours)
- Upgrade the supervisor's understanding of the subordinate's tasks

### 2. Establish Common Base
Use the meeting to develop:
- A shared base of information
- Similar ways of doing and handling things

This shared base is the foundation for efficient and effective delegation.

### 3. Facilitate Reverse Teaching
Allow the subordinate to teach you:
- Specific details and data you may only be vaguely familiar with
- Information essential for making good decisions

### 4. Joint Data Analysis
Review specific indicators together:
- Example: Trend indicators of incoming orders
- Ponder the data and consider their relationship to other industry indicators
- Distinguish between temporary anomalies (e.g., seasonal slowness) and actual business trends (e.g., business stopped growing)

### 5. Formulate Congruent Conclusions
Develop a congruent attitude, approach, and conclusion based on shared analysis.

**Example**: Deciding to take a "conservative approach to near-term investment" rather than assuming growth.

### 6. Execute Cascading Actions
- **Subordinate**: Implements decisions in their specific area of responsibility (e.g., scale back growth)
- **Supervisor**: Shares conclusions with other business groups or managers, multiplying the leverage across the organization

## Variables
- `meeting_duration`: Length of the one-on-one session (e.g., 1.5 hours)
- `impact_duration`: Period of enhanced work quality (e.g., two weeks)
- `information_base`: Shared understanding and context between supervisor and subordinate

## Prerequisites
- Regular scheduled meeting time
- Hierarchical reporting relationship
- Willingness to share information openly
- Time investment from supervisor

## Expected Result
Aligned strategic decisions, scaled operational plans, and cascaded leverage affecting other business units.
