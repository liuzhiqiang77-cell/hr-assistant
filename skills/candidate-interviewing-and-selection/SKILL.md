# Candidate Interviewing and Selection

## When to Use
- When conducting an interview session with a job candidate
- When preparing interview questions and strategy
- When checking references for a candidate
- When making a final hiring decision

## Interviewing Methodology and Techniques

### Recommended Questions
Ask specific questions to assess the candidate:

**Projects and Recognition**:
- "Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor."

**Weaknesses and Growth**:
- "What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?"

**Value Proposition**:
- "Convince me why my company should hire you."

**Problem Solving**:
- "What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?"

**Readiness**:
- "Why do you think you're ready for this new job?"

**Achievements**:
- "What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?"

### Inquiry Categories
Ensure coverage across these categories:
- **Technical/Skills**: Projects, weaknesses
- **What He Did With Knowledge**: Past achievements, past failures
- **Discrepancies**: Learning from failures, problems in current position
- **Operational Values**: Readiness for new job, why the company should hire them

### Direct Questions
Ask blunt questions (e.g., "How good are you technically?") to elicit direct answers. Observe the candidate's reaction and the confidence/timidity of the response to gauge actual capability.

### Hypothetical Situations
Walk the candidate through a specific process relevant to the job (e.g., manufacturing steps). Ask them to solve a specific problem or calculate a result to discover their problem-solving capacity and ability to derive principles on the fly.

### Candidate Questions
Ask the candidate what they would like to know about you, the company, or the job. Analyze their questions to determine what they already know, what they value, and how prepared they are.

## Interviewing Strategy and Principles

### Define the Ultimate Purpose
Judge potential contribution in a new environment by projecting past performance. Move between the world of the past employer and your own to assess fit.

### Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks
- Do not use "tricks" (e.g., three-legged chair) to test character
- Be completely straightforward; show yourself and the environment as they really are
- Rationale: A candidate is a potential employee. Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired

## Reference Checking Protocol

### Goal
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly.

### Rapport Building
- If you know the reference personally, you have a better chance of getting "real" information
- If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

### Timing
The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes due to the developed bond.

### Follow-up Interviews
If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references. Use this time to address new perspectives gained from the reference checks.

## Limitations

### Acknowledge Risk
Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success. Accept that it merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well.

### No Guarantee
There is a high risk of failure and no guarantee of success, even with thorough preparation and reference checking.
