# Performance Failure Diagnosis (Can't vs. Won't)

## When to Use
Use this diagnostic when an employee is not performing their job and the root cause is unclear. Do not use if the cause is external (e.g., equipment failure).

## Diagnostic Process

### 1. Apply the "Life or Death" Mental Test
Ask yourself: "If this person's life depended on doing the work, could he do it?"

### 2. Evaluate the Answer

**If YES:** The person is capable but NOT motivated.
- Root cause: **Motivation issue** ("won't do it")
- Intervention: Use motivation strategies

**If NO:** The person is NOT capable.
- Root cause: **Capability issue** ("can't do it")
- Intervention: Use training

### 3. Key Principle
These are the only two reasons a person does not do their job. All other interventions are useless unless the individual is trying to offer their best.

## Output
- Root cause: Capability OR Motivation
- Recommended intervention: Training OR Motivation strategies
