# Performance Review Preparation and Delivery

## When to Use
- Preparing for a performance review
- Delivering a performance assessment to a subordinate
- The review contains mixed positive and negative elements

## Preparation Phase

### Data Scanning

Review all available material:
- Progress reports
- Performance against quarterly objectives
- One-on-one meeting notes

### Brainstorming (The Worksheet)

1. Sit with a blank piece of paper
2. **Write "everything down"** regarding the subordinate's performance
3. **Do not edit in your head**
4. Include "things major, minor, and trivial" in no particular order
5. **Remember**: Writing items down does not commit you to doing anything

### Documentation Removal

Once you run out of items, **"put all of your supporting documentation away."**

### Relationship Analysis

Look for relationships between items on the worksheet:
- Identify if items are "different manifestations of the same phenomenon"
- Identify indications of why strengths/weaknesses exist

### Message Formulation

Convert identified relationships into **"messages"** for the subordinate.

### Evidence Gathering

From the worksheet:
- Draw conclusions
- Provide specific examples to support them

### Filtering

Ask yourself: **Will the subordinate be able to remember all the messages chosen?**

- If not, delete the less important ones
- Note: Excluded items can be taken up in the next review

### Handling Surprises

- Ideally, regular supervision should prevent surprises
- However, if the worksheet reveals a message that "startles you," **you must deliver it** to improve performance
- Action: "Swallow hard and bring it up."

## Delivery Phase: The Three L's

### 1. Level

**Be totally frank with your subordinate.**

- **Requirement**: Total frankness
- **Rationale**: The credibility and integrity of the entire system depend on it
- **Challenge**: Praising someone straightforwardly can be just as hard as criticizing without embarrassment

### 2. Listen

Employ your entire arsenal of sensory capabilities to ensure points are interpreted.

**Goal**: Transmit thoughts from your brain to theirs; words are just the means, getting the right thought communicated is the end.

**Constraints**:
- Do NOT use a tape recorder to confirm words used

**Identify Barriers** - Watch for signs the subordinate is:
- Too emotional to understand clear points
- Preoccupied trying to formulate answers rather than listening
- Tuned out (e.g., thinking of going fishing) as a defense mechanism, especially if the message is laden with conflict

**Verification Techniques**:
- Watch the person you are talking to
- Check for appropriate verbal and nonverbal responses
- Check if they allow themselves to receive your message

**Responsibility**: If responses do not completely assure you the message has gotten through, keep at it until satisfied. If not understood, explain again or explain differently.

**Adjustment**: Do not look away (like at a blackboard) to avoid confirming the presentation is murky.

### 3. Leave Yourself Out

Ensure the review focuses **solely on the subordinate**.

- **Principle**: The performance review is about and for your subordinate
- **Constraint**: Keep your own insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or other emotions out of it
- **Context**: At issue are the subordinate's problems; it is the subordinate's day in court
- **Emotion Management**: Control strong emotions (similar to stage fright) so they do not affect your task
