# Hiring Strategy and Reference Checking

## When to Use
- Planning overall interview strategy before candidate meetings
- Conducting reference checks after initial interviews
- Performing post-interview analysis and decision-making
- Preparing for follow-up interviews with candidates

## Strategic Principles

### 1. Define the Ultimate Purpose
The goal is to judge potential contribution in a new environment by:
- Projecting past performance forward
- Moving between the world of the past employer and your own
- Assessing how the candidate's experience translates to your context

### 2. Maintain Honesty and Avoid Tricks
Never use deceptive tactics to test character:
- Do not use tricks (e.g., three-legged chair) to test reactions
- Be completely straightforward about yourself and the environment
- Show the reality of the position and organization
- **Rationale**: A candidate is a potential employee. Wrong first impressions take a long time to change if hired.

### 3. Execute Reference Checking

#### Goal
Obtain the same information you tried to get from the candidate directly, but from external sources.

#### Rapport Building
- **Personal connection**: If you know the reference personally, you have a better chance of getting "real" information
- **Stranger protocol**: If the reference is a stranger, keep them on the phone long enough to develop a personal bond
- **Common ground**: Try to uncover common experience or association to increase openness

#### Timing Strategy
- The last 10 minutes of a half-hour conversation are more valuable than the first 10 minutes
- Allocate sufficient time for rapport to develop before asking sensitive questions

### 4. Conduct Follow-up Interviews
If possible, talk to the applicant again after checking references:
- Use this time to address new perspectives gained from reference checks
- Clarify any discrepancies or concerns raised
- Assess consistency between candidate claims and reference information

### 5. Acknowledge Limitations
- Recognize that careful interviewing does not guarantee success
- Accept that it merely increases the odds of getting lucky/hiring well
- Understanding these limitations prevents overconfidence in decisions

## Decision Output
Generate a hiring decision based on:
- Comprehensive assessment of past performance
- Reference check insights
- Alignment with organizational needs
- Acknowledged risk factors
